\section{Introduction}


\section{New or improved commands}



\subsection{Providing copy and show functions for environments}

To copy a command definition we have introduced \cs{NewCommandCopy} in
2022.  This even allows you to copy commands that consist of several internal
components, such as robust commands or those with a complex signature.
To do the same with environments, e.g., to define the environment
\env{myitemize} to be equivalent to \env{itemize}, you can now write
\begin{verbatim}
  \NewEnvironmentCopy{myitemize}{itemize}
\end{verbatim}
There are also \cs{Renew...}\ and \cs{Declare...}, which may be useful
depending on the circumstances.

In addition, we offer a \cs{ShowEnvironment} command, which displays the
\cs{begin} and \cs{end} code of the environment passed as an
argument. E.g., \verb=\ShowEnvironment{center}= results in the
following output:
\begin{verbatim}
  > \begin{center}=environment:
  > ->\trivlist \centering \item \relax .
  <recently read> }
  l. ...\ShowEnvironment{center}
  > \end{center}:
  > ->\endtrivlist .
  <recently read> }
  l. ...\ShowEnvironment{center}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Code improvements}

\subsection{\pkg{doc}: Index \texttt{\textbackslash\textvisiblespace} correctly}

\emph{to write}
%
\githubissue{943}


\subsection{Default definition for \cs{do}}

The command \cs{do} with its nice public name is in reality an
internal command inherited from plain \TeX{} for list
processing. However, it only got a definition when
\verb=\begin{document}= was executed, with a result that a user
definition in the preamble was unconditionally overwritten at this
point. To properly alert the user that this command is not freely
available we now already provide a definition in the format so that
\cs{newcommand} and friends produce a proper error message instead of
providing a definition that doesn't last.
%
\githubissue{975}


\subsection{\pkg{doc}: Support the \pkg{upquote} package}

The default quote and backquote characters in typewriter fonts are
typographical quotes, e.g., the input
\begin{verbatim}
   \verb*/`prog 'my input'`/
\end{verbatim}
 is rendered as \verb*/`prog 'my input'`/ and not as
%
\begingroup              % code to mimic upquote.sty
\catcode`'=\active
\catcode``=\active
\makeatletter
\g@addto@macro\@noligs
   {\let'\textquotesingle
    \let`\textasciigrave
    \ifx\encodingdefault\upquote@OTone
    \ifx\ttdefault\upquote@cmtt
    \def'{\char13 }%
    \def`{\char18 }%
    \fi\fi}
\endgroup
%
\verb*/`prog 'my input'`/ as preferred by many programmers.

This can be adjusted, for example, with the \pkg{upquote} package,
which results in the second output. However, for historical reasons
\pkg{doc} had its own definition of \cs{verb} and \env{verbatim} and
as a consequence the two packages did not cooperate.  This has now
been fixed and loading \pkg{upquote} together with \pkg{doc} has the
desired effect.
%
\githubissue{953}


\subsection{New key for \env{filecontents}}

The \env{filecontents} environment warns on the terminal if a file
gets overwritten even if that is intentional,
e.g., when you write a temporary file over and over again.  To make
the warning less noisy in this case we added a new \texttt{nowarn} key
that redirects the overwriting warning to the transcript file. We
think that some record of the action is still required to help with
debugging, thus it is not completely silenced. The warning that
nothing gets written, because the file aready exists (and the
\texttt{force} key was not used), is not altered and still shows up on
the terminal.
%
\githubissue{958}



\subsection{A further hook for shipping out pages}

Since October 2020 the shipout process offers a number of hooks to
adjust what is happening before, during, and after the
\cs{shipout}. For example, with the \hook{shipout/before} hook, packages
can reset code they have altered (e.g., \cs{catcode}s during
verbatim-like processing) and with \hook{shipout/background} and
\hook{shipout/foreground} material can be added to the pages.
Details are given in \cite{37:ltshipout-doc}. However, what was
missing was a hook that allows a package writer to manipulate the
completed page (with foreground and background attached) just before
the actual shipout happens.

For this we now provide the additional hook \hook{shipout}. One
use case (sometimes needed in print production) is to mirror the
whole page via \cs{reflectbox} including all the extra data that may
have been added into the fore- or background.
%
\githubissue{920}



\subsection{Displaying release information in the \texttt{.log}}

\LaTeX{} displays its release information at the very beginning of the
\LaTeX{} run on the terminal and also writes it to the transcript file
if that is already opened at this point. While this is normally true,
it is not the case if the \LaTeX{} run was started passing additional
\TeX{} code on the command line, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex '\PassOptionsToClass{11pt}{article}
              \input{myarticle}'
\end{verbatim}
In this case the release information is displayed when
\cs{PassOptionsToClass} is processed but the transcript file is only
opened when the output file name is known, i.e., after \cs{input} has
been seen, and as a result the release information is only shown on
the terminal.

To account for this scenario, we now repeat the release information
also at the very end of the transcript file where we can be sure that
it is open and ready to receive material.

\section{Bug fixes}

\subsection{Incompatibility between \pkg{doc} and \pkg{unicode-math}}

The \pkg{unicode-math} package alters the catcode of \verb=|= but does
not adjust its value for use in \pkg{doc}, with the result that
\enquote{or} module, i.e., $\langle A | B \rangle$ are displayed in a
strange way. This is now fixed with some firstaid code that will
eventually be moved into \pkg{unicode-math}.
%
\githubissue{820}


\subsection{A fix for \cs{hspace}}

The change to \cs{hspace}, done in 2020 to make it \pkg{calc} aware,
had the unfortunate side effect that starting a paragraph with
\cs{hspace} would result in the execution of \cs{everypar} inside a
group (i.e., any local changes would immediately be revoked, breaking,
for example, \pkg{wrapfig} in that special situation).
%
This got fixed with the 2022-11 PL1 hotfix, so was already corrected in
the previous release, but only now documented in a newletter.
