\section{Changes to packages in the \pkg{amsmath} category}

\subsection{Treat \cs{dots} before \cs{xrightarrow} correctly}

If one writes \verb=$ a \to \dots \to b $= the result is $ a \to \dots
\to b $, i.e., \cs{dots} are treated as binary dots. If you replace
\cs{to} with \cs{xrightarrow} then the dots suddenly become comma dots
and you have to use \cs{bdots} to get the binary dots back. This has
now been corrected for both \cs{xrightarrow} and \cs{xleftarrow}.

\githubissue{263}

\subsection{Don't lose a qed symbol with \texttt{fleqn}}

The \env{proof} environment of \pkg{amsthm} automatically puts a QED
symbol at the end of a proof.  Sometimes this is not the best place
and in that situation that author can direct \LaTeX{} to place the
symbol earlier by using \cs{qedhere} in an appropriate place. However,
when the \texttt{fleqn} option was in force this didn't always work
and the symbol got dropped in some cases. This has now been corrected.
