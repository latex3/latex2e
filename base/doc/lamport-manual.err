\title{Errata to the Second Edition of the \LaTeX\ Manual}
\author{Leslie Lamport}
\date{\moddate}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\noindent These are all the errors and omissions to the manual,
\LaTeX: {\em A Document Preparation System}, second edition, published
by Addison-Wesley, reported as of \moddate.  Positions in the book are
indicated by page and line number, where the top line of a page is
number 1 and the bottom line is number $-1$.  A running head and a
page number are not considered to be lines, but all other lines are.
Please report any additional errors to The \LaTeX\ Project at
\texttt{www.latex-project.org/bugs/}\,.


\subsection*{Errors Corrected in the First Printing}

\erratum{page 25, example of \texttt{verse} environment}
Replace \verb|{\em all\/}| by \verb|\emph{all}|.
 \reportedby{Rosemary Bailey}{29 Aug 1994}

\erratum{page 28, first paragraph} 
Not an error, but it would be
helpful to add the following sentence to the end of that paragraph:
 ``(If a declaration has arguments, they become additional
arguments of the corresponding environment's \verb|\begin| command.)''


\erratum{page 33, line 10}
Add \verb|\]| to the list of fragile commands.
 \reportedby{Rosemary Bailey}{29 Aug 1994}

\erratum{page 43, table 3.5}
Add an entry for \verb|\notin| ($\notin$).
 \reportedby{Rosemary Bailey}{29 Aug 1994}

\erratum{page 72, two examples}
Change \verb|{\em ...}| to \verb|\emph{...}|
 \reportedby{Rosemary Bailey}{29 Aug 1994}

\erratum{page 101}
This is not an error, but some readers will find it helpful if, in the
descriptions of \verb|\setlength| and \verb|\addtolength|,
\verb|\gnat| were replaced by \verb|\parskip|.  
 \reportedby{Ellen Gilkerson}{9 Aug 1994}

\erratum{page 108, lines 7 and 10}
This is not an error, but it might be easier to understand
the example if \verb|\len| were replaced by something like \verb|\saved|.
 \reportedby{Rosemary Bailey}{29 Aug 1994}

\erratum{page 139, lines $-8$ and $-9$}

The funny break between these two lines should be eliminated.
\reportedby{Malcolm Clark}{9 Aug 1994}

\erratum{page 177, line $-12$}

The \verb|twocolumn| option cannot be used with the \verb|letters|
class.

\erratum{page 197, lines 7 and 9}

The \verb|figure*| environment is ended by \verb|\end{figure*}|, and
the \verb|table*| environment is ended by \verb|\end{table*}|.
\reportedby{Malcolm Clark}{9 Aug 1994}

\erratum{page 228}

Add a note that, before running a LaTeX2.09 file in compatibility mode
in LaTeX2e, you should delete the old versions of the auxiliary files.

Change the two sentences ``None of these \ldots formula.'' to:

These text-producing commands can be used in math mode to put ordinary
text in a formula.  (When the command is used in math mode, its

formula's math-mode symbols.
\end{quote}
\reportedby{Mike Piff}{7 Mar 1995}

\erratum{page 39, line 6}

environment appears in the argument of any command.'' 
\reportedby{Eike Ritter}{May 1996}

Add ``or subentry'' after ``entry''.
\reportedby{Martin Schr\"{o}der}{22 Feb 1995}

Normal width 
  \cindex{columnwidth}%
of a column;
%  \index{column!width}% 
  \index{width!of column}% 
equals \verb|\textwidth| except for multiple-column styles.
Its value should not be changed with the length-setting commands.

Replace these five lines (which begin ``These commands are overridden'')
with:
\begin{itemize} \item[]
To override a heading on a right-hand page (any page for one-sided
printing), put a \verb|\markright| after the sectioning command and in
its mandatory argument, and add an optional argument without the
\verb|markright|, as in
\begin{itemize}
\item[]
  \verb|\chapter[Gnu Scents]{Gnu Scents\markright{|\textit{right\_head}\verb|}}|\\
 \verb|\markright{|\textit{right\_head}\verb|}|
\end{itemize}
To change the heading on a left-hand page, put a \verb|\markboth|
command immediately after the sectioning command.
\end{itemize}
\reportedby{Jerome Breitenbach}{14 Dec 1995}

\erratum{page 182} 
The dimensions
\verb|\pageheight| and \verb|\pagewidth|

respectively.  (The index entries on page 260 should also be changed.)
\reportedby{Alan Jeffrey, on behalf of a user}{12 Sep 1995}

typewriter style are not hyphenated except where permitted by \verb|\-|
commands.
\end{quote}
\reportedby{Marc Lavine}{22 Aug 1995}

\verb|\lnot| should be listed as a synonym for \verb|\neg|.
\reportedby{Chris Rowley}{15 Oct 1998}

  \index{file!nonexistent}%
is trying to read a file that apparently doesn't exist.  If the missing
file has the extension \texttt{tex}, then \LaTeX\ is trying to

\begin{description}
\item[\mytt \bs indent]
Produces a 
%  \cindex{indent}%
%  \index{paragraph!indentation}%
horizontal space whose width equals the width of the
paragraph indentation.  It can be used to add a paragraph indentation
where one would otherwise be suppressed.  (If it doesn't work,
try typing \verb|\indent\indent|.)  Robust.

\erratum{page 198, line 14}
Change ``it will not be printed'' to ``it will usually not be printed''.

\erratum{page 218, line $-14$}
Change ``\texttt{tabular}'' to ``\texttt{tabbing}''.
\reportedby{Carlos Pita}{27 Aug 2001}

\erratum{page 210, line 20}
Add a space after ``bibliography''.
\reportedby{Marcin Wolinski}{17 Sep 2003}

\subsection*{Error Corrected in the Twenty-First Printing}
\erratum{page 198, line $-11$} 
The sentence beginning ``The last three rules'' is hard to read.  Better
would be:
\begin{quote}
\noindent The last three rules are suspended when a 
  \verb|\clearpage|,\linebreak
  \verb|\cleardoublepage|, or
  \verb|\end{document}| command occurs, 
at which point all unprocessed figures and tables are allowed a

\subsection*{Uncorrected Errors}

\erratum{page 206, line 17 (\texttt{\string\multicolumn} explanation)}

Insert the following text right after ``\texttt{l}, and \texttt{r}.''
\begin{quote}
If the part of the environment's \emph{cols} argument being replaced
immediately follows an \texttt{@} expression, then the \emph{item}
will be preceded by a normal intercolumn space unless the
\verb|\multicolumn| command's \emph{col} argument begins with an
\texttt{@} expression.  In particular, beginning the \emph{col}
argument with \verb|@{}| will suppress that space.
\end{quote}
\reportedby{Ulrike Fischer, Frank Mittelbach}{23 Sep 2018}


\erratum{page 201, line $-1$ and page 202, line 1 (\emph{next\_tab\_stop}
  explanation)}
Change ``it is reset to the value of \emph{left\_margin\_tab}'' to ``it is
