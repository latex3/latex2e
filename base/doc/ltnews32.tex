\section{Introduction}

This document is under construction \ldots



\section{Other changes to the \LaTeX{} kernel}


\subsection{\cs{symbol} in math mode for large Unicode values}

The \LaTeXe{} kernel defines the command \cs{symbol}, which allows characters to be
typeset by entering their `slot number'. With the \LuaTeX{} and \XeTeX{} engines, these
slot numbers can extend to very large values to accomodate Unicode characters in the upper
Unicode planes (e.g., bold mathematical capital A is slot number \texttt{"1D400} in hex or
\texttt{119808} in decimal).
The \XeTeX{} engine did not allow \cs{symbol} in math mode for values above $2^{16}$, and
this limitation has now been lifted.

\subsection{Spacing issues when using \cs{linethickness}}

In some circumstances the use of \cs{linethickness} introduced a
spurious space that shifted objects in a \texttt{picture} environments
to the right. This has been corrected.
%
\githubissue{270}


\subsection{Adjusting \texttt{fleqn}}

In \pkg{amsmath} the \cs{mathindent} parameter used with the
\texttt{fleqn} design is a rubber length paramter allowing for setting
it to a value such as \texttt{1em minus 1em}, i.e., so the the normal
indentation can be reduced in case of very wide math displays.
This is now also supported by the \LaTeX{} standard classes.

In addition a compressable space between formula and equation number
in the \texttt{equation} environment got added when the \texttt{fleqn}
option is used so that a very wide formula doesn't bump into the
equation number.

\section{Changes to packages in the \pkg{tools} category}

\subsection{Support stretchable glue in \texttt{w}-columns}

If stretchable glue, e.g., \cs{dotfill}, is used in \env{tabular}
columns made with the \pkg{array} package, it stretches as it would in
normal paragraph text. The one exception were \texttt{w}-columns (but
not \texttt{W}-columns) were it got forced to its nominal width (which
in case if \cs{hfill} or \cs{dotfill} is 0\,pt). This has been
corrected and now \texttt{w}-columns behave like all other column
types in this respect.
