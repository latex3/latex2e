This file (\texttt{\jobname.err}) can be found as part of the \LaTeX{}
distribution and its latest version is maintained on the \LaTeX{}
project site at \texttt{https://www.latex-project.org/help/books/\jobname.err}
where you will also find extracts of the book.

The first column in the table shows the page number of the errata
entry.  Superscript numbers in the first column refer to the printed
revision in which this entry was corrected (\textit{s} indicates a
correction in the sources only). The second
column gives the precise location (negative line or paragraph numbers
are counted from the bottom of the page). The third column shows the
first finder of the problem.

You can customize this list to only show errata related to the printing
or digital edition
you own by changing the configuration in the file \texttt{\jobname.cfg}.

\begin{center}
  \large \bfseries  To Err is Human --- Bug Contest
\end{center}

Any mistake found and reported is a gain for all readers of our book.
For this reason Addison-Wesley and the authors offer a prize (for 5
limited time periods) to the eligible person who finds the largest number of bugs
during that period (more precisely, it is a lottery among the people
with the 5 top-most findings up to that point).  A person can receive
at most one prize, ever; errors found by any of the authors do not
count.

Each prize is a free choice of any single computing book found on the
Addison-Wesley/Pearson web site:
\texttt{https://www.informit.com} (that
is, no boxed sets or multiple volume offers).


As usual, the authors and publisher reserve the right to make various
decisions such as whether a reported feature is an error for
competitive purposes or whether similar features count as a single or
multiple errors.  ---
Good luck!

Due to its size the third edition of \textit{The \LaTeX{} Companion} is printed
as a two-volume set. The digital version, however, is provided as a
single PDF or ePub. This means that a small fraction of the digital
content differs from that of the printed version: there is only a
single front matter, a single bibliography, and a single index, whereas
in the printed books these are separated out. However, all versions share the main
matter (down to the page numbering) so most of the errata apply to
all versions, but a few only to the digital and some only to the
printed version. Thus, we end up with three separate lists.

\section{Errata for the print version (not applicable to the digital version)}

The printed books differ from the digital version in that the
bibliography is split across both volumes (with a few repeats) and
the front matter of each volume has its own table of contents and list
of figures and tables. Therefore these parts have different page
numbers and you will see similar errata entries for both print and
digital differing only in that respect.

\begin{erratalist}

\CHAPTER{General} 

\erroronpage{}{}{FMi}{2023/07/30}{}

Text or graphics typeset in the spot color (blue) are not always
perfectly aligned. This is a side-effect of the printing technology.
On most pages everything is fine, but occasionally blue text in a
paragraph seems to be slightly above or below the baseline or blue
text in tables appears slightly misaligned horizontally. It differs
from book to book (and therefore not recorded in this errata) and
can't be controlled by the authors, unfortunately.

ones.

%<--------------------------


\section{Errata common to the print and digital versions}

The main matter is identical (also in page numbers) in the print and
the digital versions. Therefore most errata entries appear in this
section.

\begin{erratalist}


\CHAPTER{General}

\erroronpage{}{}{FMi}{2023/04/04}{}
Some corrections result in index changes. These are not tracked here;
the index is always fully regenerated for new printings.

\erroronpage{}{}{MJo/FMi}{2023/07/07}{}

  There are a dozen occurrences of the word \u{rôle} throughout the book,
  which is more commonly spelled \u{role}. However, this is not wrong
  but is the somewhat dated form used mostly in British
  English. Personally, I prefer the version with accent (as does Don
  Knuth) so it is deliberate and will not change.


\CHAPTER{Preface}

\erroronpage{I-xlii}{para 1, l.3}{FMi}{2024/04/01}{2}
\u{the designer} of the Lato fonts \> \u{a co-designer} of the Lato fonts


\CHAPTER{Chapter 1 --- Introduction}

\erroronpage{I-5}{para 4, l.4}{kb}{2023/04/04}{2}
\u{of} the bugs \> \u{with} the bugs

\erroronpage{I-5}{para 5, l.5}{kb}{2023/04/04}{2}
not least \> \u{but} not least

\erroronpage{I-10}{para -1, l.2}{ACa}{2024/06/05}{2}

The value should have been shown with an upright mu, using
\verb=\qty{0.01}{\micro\metre}= from the \pkg{siunitx} package.


\erroronpage{I-18}{before 1.3.3}{ACa/FMi}{2024/06/05}{2}

Add paragraph:\\
%
There are also two sections (2.2.8 and 2.3.4) providing low-level
background information for reference---useful when looking at existing
code in older document class files. They are set in a slightly smaller
typeface to save space and to indicate their special nature as
reference material, rather than material for daily use.

\erroronpage{I-19}{}{FMi}{2025/05/17}{s}

Added a new section ``1.3.4 Errata for this book'' to explain
how to obtain and use this errata file


\CHAPTER{Chapter 2 --- The Structure of a \LaTeX{} Document}

\erroronpage{I-31}{para-1,l.-1}{BeB}{2024/03/17}{2}
would have resulted in ``\verb+# .+'' in the output. \> \\
would have resulted in ``\verb+#+\u{\texttt{\&}}\verb+ .+'' in the output.

\erroronpage{I-34}{l.-1}{FMi}{2023/04/04}{2}
Moved first line of page 35 to 34.


\erroronpage{I-35}{l.1}{FMi}{2023/04/04}{2}
Moved first line of page 35 to 34.


\erroronpage{I-70}{section 2.3.4}{FMi}{2023/06/05}{2}

Add footnote: The whole section is set in a smaller font to indicate
that is more a reference — helpful mainly when studying existing code.

\erroronpage{I-79}{para -2, l.1}{KSh}{2025/05/06}{s}
Change:
If \u{\cs{varioref}} is loaded \>
If \u{\texttt{varioref}} is loaded

\erroronpage{I-98}{para -1, l.3}{KSh}{2025/05/06}{s}
Change:
from Section \u{7} on page 53 \>
from Section \u{2.2.8} on page 53

\erroronpage{I-113}{listing}{FMi}{2023/05/14}{2}
Situation is the same in the 2023 distributions; listing output updated.


\erroronpage{I-117}{l.-5}{BeB}{2023/07/25}{2}
\textit{latexrelease} \> \texttt{latexrelease}

\erroronpage{I-118}{para 2, l.-2}{KSh}{2025/05/06}{s}
Replace:
that \u{the new} version is dated \>
that \u{this} version is dated

\CHAPTER{Chapter 3 --- Basic Formatting Tools -- Paragraph \ldots}

\erroronpage{I-143}{exa 3-1-18}{BeB}{2024/03/17}{2}
Replace in source: \verb+{ peine+ \> \verb+{peine+


\erroronpage{I-154}{para 3.1}{KSh}{2025/05/06}{s}

Replace with:\\
We finish the section with two packages that help with special
formatting needs: \texttt{xfrac} produces fractions such as
1/2, 2/3, or 3/4 for use in running text
and \texttt{siunitx} typesets quantities according to the rules of
the International System of Units~(SI).

\erroronpage{I-156}{exa 3-3-17}{FMi}{2025/05/06}{s}

This examples was formatted with a broken xfrac version and therefore
shows results that differ from what is described in the surrounding
text.

\erroronpage{I-157}{l.1}{KSh}{2025/05/06}{s}
Delete spurious word: if this \u{it} is not desired

\erroronpage{I-160}{para -2, l.1}{BeB}{2023/07/14}{2}
Repeated word: keys \u{keys} \> keys

as we did \u{above}. \>  as we did \u{in Example 3-3-14 below}.

\erroronpage{I-163}{para 3, margin}{FMi}{2023/07/26}{2}
Add a marginal note: \u{No warning if another \LaTeX{} run is necessary!}

\erroronpage{I-163}{example 3-3-14}{BeB}{2023/07/25}{2}
Output of example misses the page numbers in acronym list \> Run example 3 times (not only twice---there is no warning)

\erroronpage{I-174}{para3,l. -2}{BeB}{2024/03/17}{2}
the exponent is always a \u{power} of 3 \> the exponent is always a 
\u{multiple} of 3

\seriouserroronpage{I-177}{exa 3-3-39}{BeB/FMi}{2024/03/17}{2}

The example doesn't really show what the paragraph above discusses
because it was shortend to fit the available space on the page.
Use
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand\sample[1]{\textnormal{\noindent #1:}
 The limit is \qty{30}{\kmh} not $\qty{50}{\kmh}$.\par}}
\end{verbatim}

Add:

Sometimes it is more convenient to explicitly specify all the
horizontal spacing yourself within the formula. For this you can use
an \env{alignat} environment. It differs from \env{align} in two ways: you have to
specify the number of \texttt{rl} pairs as an argument to the environment and
it does not add any spaces between the pairs, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{alignat}{3} x &= y &\qquad X &= Y &\qquad a &= b+c \\ ...
\end{verbatim}
As usual, equation numbers can be altered with \cs{tag} or suppressed with \cs{notag}.

   To help you in assessing this errata document we have placed
   exclamation marks in front of each entry that we consider essential
   for correctly understanding the book contents.

\erroronpage{general}{}{FMi}{2004/05/14}{}

   Due to the printing process there may be small alignment problems
   between blue and black text on some pages. These can vary from book
   to book depending on how the paper was handled between print
   runs---such is the analog nature of printing on a press.
