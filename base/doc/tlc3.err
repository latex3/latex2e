distribution and its latest version is maintained on the \LaTeX{}
project site at \texttt{https://www.latex-project.org/help/books/\jobname.err}
where you will also find extracts of the book.

The first column in the table shows the page number of the errata
entry.  Superscript numbers in the first column refer to the printed
revision in which this entry was corrected (\textit{s} indicates a
correction in the sources only). The second
column gives the precise location (negative line or paragraph numbers
are counted from the bottom of the page). The third column shows the
first finder of the problem.

You can customize this list to only show errata related to the printing
you own by changing the configuration in the file \texttt{\jobname.cfg}.

  \Large \bfseries  To Err is Human --- Bug Contest
\end{center}

Any mistake found and reported is a gain for all readers of our book.
For this reason Addison-Wesley and the authors offer a prize (for 5
periods) to the eligible person who finds the largest
number of bugs during that period (in case of a draw a random choice
will be made between all those with the largest number of findings).
A person can receive at most one prize, ever; errors found by any of
the authors do not count.

Each prize is a free choice of any single computing book found on the
Addison-Wesley/Pearson web site:
\texttt{https://www.informit.com} (that
is, no boxed sets or multiple volume offers).


As usual, the authors and publisher reserve the right to make various
decisions such as whether a reported feature is an error for
competitive purposes or whether similar features count as a single or
multiple errors.  ---
Good luck!

Due to its size the third edition of \textit{The \LaTeX{} Companion} is printed
as a two-volume set. The digital version, however, is provided as a
single PDF or ePub. This means that a small fraction of the digital
content differs from that of the printed version: there is only a
single font matter, a single bibliography, and a single index, whereas
in the printed books these are separated out. However, all versions share the main
matter (down to the page numbering) so most of the errata applies to
all versions, but a few only to the digital and some only to the
printed version. Thus, we end up with three separate lists.

\section*{Errata for the print version (not applicable to the digital version)}

The printed books differ from the digital version in that the
bibliography is split across both volumes (with a few repeats) and that
the font matter of each volume has its own table of contents and list
of figures and tables. Therefore these parts have different page
numbers and you will see similar errata entries for both print and
digital differing only in that respect.

\section*{Errata common to the print and digital versions}

The main matter is identical (also in page numbers) in the print and
the digital versions. Therefore most errata entries appear in this
section.

\erroronpage{I-619}{exa 8-4-7}{FMi}{2023/05/30}{s}
The example uses \verb*/left color=red!20/ but this is not really
visible if the red is turned into some gray value in the book (which
is then made even lighter through \texttt{!20}). So it is better to
start from full red, i.e., \> \verb*/left color=red/ instead.

\erroronpage{II-139}{bottom}{FMi}{2023/04/04}{s}
Add:

Sometimes it is more convenient to explicitly specify all the
horizontal spacing yourself within the formula. For this you can use
an \env{alignat} environment. It differs from \env{align} in two ways: you have to
specify the number of \texttt{rl} pairs as an argument to the environment and
it does not add any spaces between the pairs, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{alignat}{3} x &= y &\qquad X &= Y &\qquad a &= b+c \\ ...
\end{verbatim}
As usual, equation numbers can be altered with \cs{tag} or suppressed with \cs{notag}.
\\ Already corrected in the digital version.


\erroronpage{II-140}{para 1, l.2}{bb/FMi}{2023/04/04}{s}

Do not forget to reset \cs{minalignsep} if you change it in this manner.

You can think of them as subsidiary environments that can be used

them inside equation).
\\ Already corrected in the digital version.

\erroronpage{II-145}{para 2, l.1}{bb/FMi}{2023/04/04}{s}

Another problem is that an empty line introduces an unwanted break
point in front of the display, thus \cs{predisplaypenalty} is no
longer honored.
\\ Already corrected in the digital version.

   between blue and black text on some pages. These can vary from book
