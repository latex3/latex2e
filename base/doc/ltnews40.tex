\subsection{Avoiding keyval option clashes between classes and packages}

In \LaTeX{} News~35~\cite{40:ltnews35} we introduced keyval option processing
to the kernel. Following the standard for \LaTeXe{} options, keyval options
given to the \cs{documentclass} line were treated as global and so parsed by
every package. However, with keyvals, the likelihood of a name clash between a
class-specific option and one used by a package is much higher than it is with
simple strings. We have therefore refined the mechanism in the current release.

When a class uses the kernel keyval processor, any options it recognises are
recorded and any packages using the keyval processor will then \emph{skip}
these \enquote{global} options. To allow for the case where a class directly
uses an option which should be global (for example \texttt{draft}), a new key
property \texttt{.pass-to-packages} has been added. This can then be set to
indicate that this key is not to be skipped. For example
\begin{verbatim}
\DeclareKeys{
  draft .if = {ifl@cls@draft},
  draft .pass-to-packages = true,
  mode  .store = \cls@mode
}
\end{verbatim}
in a class would create two options, \texttt{draft} and \texttt{mode}. The
\texttt{draft} option will be treated in the normal way by packages using
keyvals, but they will ignore the \texttt{mode} option: it is effectively
marked as \enquote{private} to the class.

\section{Bug fixes}

\subsection{Fix wrong file type in a rollback warning}

When \LaTeX{} is rolled back to date \meta{date1} and a class or
package with minimum date requirement \meta{date2} is to be loaded, a
rollback warning is raised if \meta{date2} is later than \meta{date1}:
\begin{verbatim}
LaTeX Warning: Suspicious rollback/min-date date given
               A minimal date of YYYY-MM-DD has been specified for package
               '<pkgname>'.
               But this is in conflict with a rollback request to YYYY-MM-DD.
\end{verbatim}

In some cases this message showed a wrong file type, i.e.,
\verb|document class '<pkgname>'| or \verb|package '<clsname>'|.
This has now been corrected.

\githubissue{870}

\subsection*{Fix existence check of document environments}
\cs{NewDocumentEnvironment} and friends define (or redefine) a document
environment using the space-trimmed \meta{envname}, but the existence
check for \meta{envname} was done without space trimming. Thus when the
user-specified \meta{envname} consists of leading and/or trailing
space(s), it may lead to erroneously silent environment declaration.
For example, in
\begin{verbatim}
  \NewDocumentEnvironment{myenv}{}{begin}{end}
  \NewDocumentEnvironment{ myenv }{}{begin}{end}
\end{verbatim}
the first line defines a new environment \env{myenv} but the second
line would check existence for \env{ myenv } (which is not yet defined),
then redefine \env{myenv} environment without raising any errors.
This has now been corrected.

\subsection{\pkg{doc}:\ \cs{PrintDescribeMacro} in preamble}

In \pkg{doc} version 2 it was possible alter the definition of
\cs{PrintDescribeMacro} and similar commands in preamble. In version 3
this stopped working because they go reset at the end of the
preamble. This has now been implemented differently and changes in the
preamble are possible again.

\section{Improvement to \XeTeX\ \cs{showhyphens}}
When using \cs{showhyphens} with \XeTeX, missing character warnings
would be generated for any character not in Latin Modern. This has been
corrected and the warnings are suppressed.
