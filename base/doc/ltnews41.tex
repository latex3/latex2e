\section{Replacement for the legacy mark mechanism}



\LaTeX{}'s legacy mechanism only supported two classes (left and right
marks) and setting the left mark (with \cs{markboth}) always altered
the state of the right mark as well, i.e., they were far from
independent. For generating running headers with \enquote{chapter
  titles} on the left and \enquote{section titles} on the right they
work reasonably well but without much flexibility, e.g., \cs{leftmark}
always generated the first \enquote{left}-mark on the page, while
\cs{rightmark} always generated the last \enquote{right}-mark.

A few releases ago~\cite{41:ltnews35} we therefore introduced a new
mark mechanism for \LaTeX{} that supports arbitrary many truly
independent mark classes and also offers querying the state at the top
of the page, something that wasn't available in \LaTeX{} at all.

Up to now, both mechanisms coexisted with completely separate
implementations. With this release we have retired the legacy code and
instead implement its public interfaces by using the new concepts,
i.e., \cs{markboth}, \cs{markright}, \cs{leftmark}, and \cs{rightmark}
remain supported but internally use \cs{InsertMark}, etc.  Existing
document classes or documents using the interfaces will therefore
continue to work without any modifications but use a single underlying
implementation and new documents can benefit from the additional
flexibility, e.g., by displaying not only the last right-mark
(\cs{leftmark} or \verb=\LastMark{2e-right}=) but also the first
right-mark (\verb=\FirstMark{2e-right}=) or the top right-mark
(\verb=\TopMark{2e-right}=), etc.

See~\cite{41:ltmarks} for details on the extended functionality.



\section{News from Tagged PDF project}

The \texttt{testphase} key now takes also the value \texttt{latest}.
This will load all modules that we recommend
so that it is not necessary to specify individual modules. The list of loaded modules
will be adjusted as needed when the project progresses. It is also written to the log.

\subsection{Fixing the spacing after display math}

When \LaTeX{} produces an accessible (tagged) PDF it has to add
structure data into the PDF to mark (i.e., tag) individual
elements. If the \pdfTeX{} engine is used this has to be done with the
help of \cs{pdfliteral}s which are whatsit nodes like
\cs{special} or \cs{write}. This means that they should be added only in
places, where these extra nodes are not affecting the spacing\Dash \TeX{}
can't, for example, look backwards past such a whatsit node so
consecutive spaces that are normally collapsed into one, suddenly
appear both, if such a node separates them.

The situation is especially complicated with math displays, because
there \TeX{} adds penalties and spaces with low-level procedures, that
are not directly accessible from the macro level, and the tagging
structures have to appear somewhere in the middle of that to ensure
that the formula and the PDF structures are not separated by page
break. Because of this it is necessary to use some fairly complex
methods (essentially disable \TeX's mechanisms and reprogram them on
the macro level) to get the structure data in the right places.

Our first attempt in doing that was slightly faulty and resulted in
some cases in an extra space (an additional \cs{parskip} space when
there shouldn't be one). This has now corrected and the gymnastics to
achieve this are rather an \enquote{interesting} study in obfuscated
\TeX{} coding.

In \LuaTeX{} the situation is much better because there the structures can
be added later when the formula processing has already finished.

\section{New or improved commands}

\subsection{Socket and plug conditionals}

It is sometimes necessary/helpful to know if a particular socket or
plug exists (or is assigned to a certain socket) and based on that
take different actions. With the current release we added
conditionals, such as \cs{IfSocketExistsTF}, to support such
scenarios. Corresponding L3 programming layer conditionals are also
provided.

\githubissue{1577}

\section{Code improvements}

\subsection{Refinement of \cs{MakeTitlecase}}

We introduced \cs{MakeTitlecase} as a late addition to the June
2022 release, making use of the improved case code in
\pkg{expl3}. Unlike upper and lowercasing, making text
titlecased is more tricky to get right: this can apply either to
the whole text or on a word-by-word basis.

A subtle issue was reported against the \pkg{expl3} repository
(\url{https://github.com/latex3/latex3/issues/1316}) which links
to how we deal with the question of case changing
\enquote{words} but shows up if you titlecase text stored in a
command.

We have looked again at how to implement \cs{MakeTitlecase} to
be as predictable as possible, and have made a change in this
release. The command no longer tries to lowercase text before
applying titlecasing, and gives the correct result for text
stored in commands.

We have also added an additional key to the optional argument to
\cs{MakeTitlecase} which allows the user to decide if this will
apply only to the first word (the default) or to all words.

\subsection{Tab character as a special}

In \LaTeX{} News~38, we described the extension of \cs{verb}, etc., to cover
the tab character as equivalent to a space. We have now added tabs to the
standard list of characters covered by \cs{dospecials}. This allows them to
be used in for example a \texttt{v}~specification document command without
additional steps.

\subsection{Logging text command and symbol declarations}

For thirty years the documentation claimed that \cs{DeclareTextSymbol},
\cs{DeclareTextCommand}, and friends log their changes, but in
contrast to their math counterparts they never did. This has now
finally changed.
%
\githubissue{1242}

\subsection{Supporting the \texttt{ssc} and \texttt{sw} shapes}

The \texttt{ssc} shape (spaced small capitals) is supported in
\LaTeX{} through the commands \cs{sscshape} and \cs{textssc}. However,
until this release there where no font shape change rules defined for
this admittely seldom available shape, so that
\begin{verbatim}
  \sscshape\itshape
\end{verbatim}
changed unconditionally to \texttt{it} (italics) rather than to
\texttt{sscit} (spaced small italic capitals).  Thanks to Michael
Ummels, the missing declarations have now been added so that shape
changes in font families that support spaced small capitals work
properly.

At the same time we took the opportunity to improve the fallbacks for
the \texttt{sw} (swash) shapes, which are accessible through the
commands \cs{swshape} or \cs{textsw}. If an \texttt{sw} combination is
not available, the rules now try to replace \texttt{sw} with
\texttt{it} rather than falling back to \texttt{n}.
%
\githubissue{1581}

\subsection{Improvement of the NFSS font series management}

\LaTeX's font selection mechanism (NFSS) supports 9~weight levels,
from ultra-light~(\texttt{ul}) to ultra-bold~(\texttt{ub}), and also
9~width levels, from ultra-condensed~(\texttt{uc}) to
ultra-expanded~(\texttt{ux}). With the February~2020 release, this
mechanism was extended so that requests to set the weight or the width
attributes of the series are combined in a sensible
way~\cite{41:ltnews31}: E.g., if you typeset a paragraph in a
condensed face using \verb+\fontseries{c}\selectfont+ and then use
\cs{textbf} inside the paragraph, a bold condensed face is
selected. The combination of the series values is done by consulting a
simple lookup table whose entries are defined with
\cs{DeclareFontSeriesChangeRule}.

Until now, this lookup table was missing some entries, especially with
regard to rarely used width values. In such cases, the series values
were not combined as expected. This has been fixed (thanks to Maurice
Hansen) by adding numerous \cs{DeclareFontSeriesChangeRule} entries so
that the full range of weights (from \texttt{ul} to \texttt{ub}) and
widths (from \texttt{uc} to \texttt{ux}) is now supported when
combining font series values.

\subsection{Supporting the \texttt{ssc} and \texttt{sw} shapes}

The \texttt{ssc} shape (spaced small capitals) is supported in
\LaTeX{} through the commands \cs{sscshape} and \cs{textssc}. However,
until this release there where no font shape change rules defined for
this admittely seldom available shape, so that
\begin{verbatim}
  \sscshape\itshape
\end{verbatim}
changed unconditionally to \texttt{it} (italics) rather than to
\texttt{sscit} (spaced small italic capitals).  Thanks to Michael

changes in font families that support spaced small capitals work

not available, the rules now try to replace \texttt{sw} with
\texttt{it} rather than falling back to \texttt{n}.

\section{Bug fixes}

\subsection{Fix the use of  \texttt{localmathalpabets}}

In 2021 we introduced a method to overcome the problem that classic
\TeX{} engines (but not the Unicode engines) have only a limited
number of math alphabets available that got easily fill up simply by
loading math font packages, even if their symbols got used only
occasionally. The idea was to avoid allocating all math alphabets
globally, but instead allow a number of them (defined by counter
\texttt{localmathalpabets}) to vary from one formula to the next. This
way different formulas can make use of different alphabets and chances
are much higher that the processing a complex the document succeeds.
See~\cite{41:ltnews34} for details.

Unfortunately, the approach taken failed in some cases of nested
formulas with the result that the wrong symbol glyphs were used.
This has now been corrected.

\githubissue[s]{1101 1028}

\subsection{\pkg{docstrip}:\ Error if \texttt{.ins} file is problematical}

If a file to generate had the same name as a preamble declared with
\cs{declarepreamble} the preamble definition was overwritten because
the macro used to store it was reused for denoting the output
stream. The same problem happened with postambles declared with
\cs{declarepostamble}. This is now detected and an error message is
issued. To circumvent the issue in that case, simply use a different
macro name for the preamble or postamble.
%
\githubissue{1150}


\subsection{Prevent \texttt{cmd} hook from defining an undefined command}

Using \verb=\AddToHook{cmd/FOO/...}= when the command \cs{FOO} was
undefined resulted in the command becoming \cs{relax}. Thus, if used,
it no longer raised an \enquote{Undefined control sequence} error but silently
did nothing. This behavior has been corrected and if the command
\cs{FOO} isn't defined later, e.g., in a package, it now raises an
error if it is used in the document.
%
\githubissue{1591}

\subsection{Process global options once per package}

In 2022, we introduced key--value (keyval) option processing in the
kernel~\cite{41:ltnews35}. This also added the idea that keys could have scope:
load-only, preamble-only and general use. However, we overlooked that an option
given globally (in the optional argument to \cs{documentclass}) would be
repeatedly processed and could therefore lead to spurious warnings. This has
now been corrected: global options are seen exactly once per package by the
keyval-based option handling system.
%
\githubissue{1619}

\section{Documentation}
\subsection{Clarifying space handling of \cs{textcolor}}

In contrast to other \cs{\text}-commands like \cs{textbf} or \cs{textrm},
the command \cs{textcolor} gobbles spaces at the start of its argument, so \verb=Hello\textcolor{red}{  World}= will output Hello\textcolor{red}{  World}.
This behaviour has now been clarified in the documentation.
%
\githubissue{1474}

%\section{Changes to packages in the \pkg{amsmath} category}

\section{Changes to packages in the \pkg{graphics} category}

\subsection{More accessibility keys in \pkg{graphicx}}

The \cs{includegraphics} command now accepts \verb|actualtext| and
\verb|artifact| keys, which by default do nothing but are used by the
tagging code to provide an ActualText string and a boolean flag that the
graphic is an artifact.
%
\githubissue{1552}

\section{Changes to packages in the \pkg{tools} category}

\subsection{\pkg{multicol}:\ Full support for extended marks}

In 2022 we introduced a new mark mechanism for
\LaTeX{}~\cite{41:ltnews35}. However, the initial implementation only
covered the standard output routine of \LaTeX{}. As a result the
extended marks were not available within columns produced with the
\pkg{multicol} package (where they would be especially useful). This
limitation has finally been lifted and the new mechanism is now fully
supported.
%
\githubissue{1421}



\subsection{\pkg{array}:\ Improve preamble setup code for \texttt{p} and friends}

While the preamble of a \env{tabular} or \env{array} is being built
the arguments to \texttt{p}, \texttt{m}, or \texttt{b} columns got
expanded several times. This is normally harmless because that
argument contains usually just a dimension. However, in a case like
\verb=p{\fpeval{15}pt}= this resulted in an error, because \cs{fpeval}
was expanded a few times, but not often enough to result in a single
number. This has now been corrected and the argument is not expanded
at all to allow for such edge cases as well as the extension available
with the \pkg{calc} package, such as \verb=p{\widthof{AAAAAA}}= (the
latter was possible before but needed to be taken into account while
the correction was implemented).
%
\githubissue{1585}


\subsection[\pkg{varioref}:\ How to make \cs{reftex...}\ empty]
           {\pkg{varioref}:\ How to make \cs{reftexfaceafter}, etc.\ empty}

In the case that one wants to make a command such as
\cs{reftextfaceafter} produce nothing, one has to get rid of the space that
is automatically placed in front of the command. This can be done by simply
defining the command to remove it, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
  \renewcommand\reftextfaceafter{\unskip}
\end{verbatim}
The \pkg{varioref} package does not test if such strings are empty,
because that would require a lot of tests each time \cs{vref} is used,
and it would nearly always find that the text is not empty. However,
as shown above, the solution for this uncommon case is simple, and it
is now explicitly documented in the package documentation.
