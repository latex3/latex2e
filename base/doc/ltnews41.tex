\subsection{Refinement of \cs{MakeTitlecase}}

We introduced \cs{MakeTitlecase} as a late addition to the June
2022 release, making use of the improved case code in
\pkg{expl3}. Unlike upper and lowercasing, making text
titlecased is more tricky to get right: this can apply either to
the whole text or on a word-by-word basis.

A subtle issue was reported against the \pkg{expl3} repository
(\url{https://github.com/latex3/latex3/issues/1316}) which links
to how we deal with the question of case changing
\enquote{words} but shows up if you titlecase text stored in a
command.

We have looked again at how to implement \cs{MakeTitlecase} to
be as predictable as possible, and have made a change in this
release. The command no longer tries to lowercase text before
applying titlecasing, and gives the correct result for text
stored in commands.
