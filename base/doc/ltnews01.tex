\section{Welcome to \LaTeXNews}

An issue of \emph{\LaTeXNews} will accompany every future release of
\LaTeX.  It will tell you about important events, such as major bug
fixes, newly available packages, or any other \LaTeX{} news.

\section{\LaTeXe---the new \LaTeX{} release}

The most important news is the release of \LaTeXe, the new version of
the \LaTeX{} software.  This version has better support for fonts,
graphics and colour, and will be actively maintained by the \LaTeX\
Project team.  Upgrades will be issued every six months, in June and
December.

\section{Why a new \LaTeX?}

Over the years many extensions have been developed for \LaTeX. This
is, of course, a sure sign of its continuing popularity but it has had
one unfortunate result: incompatible \LaTeX{} formats came into use at
different sites. Thus, to process documents from various places, a
site maintainer was forced to keep \LaTeX{} (with and without \NFSS),
\SLiTeX, \AmSLaTeX, and so on.  In addition, when looking at a source
file it was not always clear for which format the document was written.

To put an end to this unsatisfactory
situation a new release of \LaTeX{} was produced.
It brings all such extensions back under a single format and thus
prevents the proliferation of mutually incompatible dialects of
\LaTeX~2.09. The new release was available for several months as a
test version, and the final release of 1~June officially
replaces the old version.

\section{Processing documents with \LaTeXe}

Documents written for \LaTeX~2.09 will
still be read by \LaTeXe.  Any such document is run in
\emph{\LaTeX~2.09 compatibility mode}.

Unfortunately, compatibility mode comes with a price: it can run
up to 50\% slower than \LaTeX~2.09 did.  If you want to run your document
in the faster \emph{native mode}, you should try replacing the line:
\begin{verbatim}
   \documentstyle[<options>,<packages>]{<class>}
\end{verbatim}
with:
\begin{verbatim}
   \documentclass[<options>]{<class>}
   \usepackage{latexsym,<packages>}
\end{verbatim}
Unfortunately, this will not always work, because some \LaTeX~2.09
packages will only work in \LaTeXe{} compatibility mode.  You should find
out if there is a \LaTeXe{} version of the package available.

\LaTeXe{} native mode also gives access to the new features of \LaTeXe,
described in \emph{\LaTeXe{} for authors}.

\section{New packages}

\LaTeXe{} has much better support for graphics, colour, fonts, and
multi-lingual typesetting.  The following software should be available
from the distributor who brought you \LaTeXe:

\begin{citations}
\item[babel] for typesetting in many languages.
\item[color] for colour support.
\item[graphics] for including images.
\item[mfnfss] for using bitmap fonts.
\item[psnfss] for using Type~1 fonts.
\item[tools]  other packages by the \LaTeX\ Project team.
\end{citations}
The packages come with full documentation, and are also described in
\emph{\LaTeX: A Document Processing System} or
\emph{The \LaTeX{} Companion}.
