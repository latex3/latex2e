! Package doc Error: Doc element 'Option/option' already defined?
See the doc package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
l. ...\NewDocElement   {Option}{option}
There is already a definition for '\PrintOptionName',
'\PrintDescribeOption' or the environment 'option'.
Maybe you are overwriting something by mistake!
Otherwise use '\RenewDocElement' instead.

                                       % doesn't work either in this case!
I expected an existing definition for '\PrintOptionName',
'\PrintDescribeOption' and the environment 'option' but
not all of them are defined.
Maybe you wanted to use '\NewDocElement'?
