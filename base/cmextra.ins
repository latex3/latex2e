This file may only be distributed together with a copy of the LaTeX

In particular, permission is granted to customize the declarations in
this file to serve the needs of your installation.

However, a modified version of this file under its original name

the modification will be nontransparent for the user of that
distribution (and thus violating clause 6a of the LPPL license),
making successful document exchange impossible.
