my-package added CODE:

Adding a rule:
-> The hook 'some-hook-a':
> Code chunks:
>     my-package -> CODE
> Document-level (top-level) code (executed last):
>     ---
> Extra code for next invocation:
>     ---
> Rules:
>     ---
> Execution order:
>     my-package.
-------------------
Now there are no code chunks:
-> The hook 'some-hook-a':
> The hook is empty.
-------------------
my-package added CODE:
-> The hook 'some-hook-b':
> The hook is not declared.
> Code chunks:
>     my-package -> CODE
> Document-level (top-level) code:
>     ---
> Extra code for next invocation:
>     ---
> Rules:
>     ---
> Execution order:
>     Not set because the hook is undeclared.

Adding a rule:
-> The hook 'some-hook-a':

-------------------
Now there are no code chunks:
-> The hook 'some-hook-b':
> The hook is not declared.

-------------------
No code:
-> The hook 'some-hook-a':
> The hook is empty.
-------------------
Adding a rule:
-> The hook 'some-hook-a':
> The hook is empty.
-------------------
Still no code:
-> The hook 'some-hook-a':
> The hook is empty.
-------------------
No code:
-> The hook 'some-hook-b':
> The hook is not declared.
> The hook is empty.
