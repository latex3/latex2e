--------------------------------------------------------------

It may be distributed and/or modified under the
conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3c
of this license or (at your option) any later version.
The latest version of this license is in
   https://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
and version 1.3c or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
version 2008 or later.

This file may only be distributed together with a copy of the LaTeX
base system. You may however distribute the LaTeX base system without
such generated files.

The list of all files belonging to the LaTeX base distribution is
given in the file `manifest.txt'. See also `legal.txt' for additional
information.

In particular, permission is granted to customize the declarations in
this file to serve the needs of your installation.

However, a modified version of this file under its original name
should not be distributed as part of a standard LaTeX distribution, as
the modification will be nontransparent for the user of that
distribution (and thus violating clause 6a of the LPPL license),
making successful document exchange impossible.
