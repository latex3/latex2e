% \section{Introduction}
%
%    Hooks are points in the code of commands or environments where it
%    is possible to add processing code into existing commands. This
%    can be done by different packages that do not know about each
%    other and to allow for hopefully safe processing it is necessary
%    to sort different chunks of code added by different packages into
%    a suitable processing order.
%
%    This is done by the packages adding chunks of code (via
%    \cs{AddToHook}) and labeling their code with some label by
%    default using the package name as a label.
%
%    At \verb=\begin{document}= all code for a hook is then sorted
%    according to some rules (given by \cs{DeclareHookRule}) for fast
%    execution without processing overhead. If the hook code is
%    modified afterwards (or the rules are changed),
%    a new version for fast processing is generated.
%
%    Some hooks are used already in the preamble of the document. If
%    that happens then the hook is prepared for execution (and sorted)
%    already at that point.
%
%
% \section{Package writer interface}
%
%    The hook management system is offered as a set of CamelCase
%    commands for traditional \LaTeXe{} packages (and for use in the
%    document preamble if needed) as well as \texttt{expl3} commands
%    for modern packages, that use the L3 programming layer of
%    \LaTeX{}. Behind the scenes, a single set of data structures is
%    accessed so that packages from both worlds can coexist and access
%    hooks in other packages.
%
%
%
% \subsection{\LaTeXe\ interfaces}
%
% \subsubsection{Declaring hooks}
%
%  With a few exceptions, hooks have to be declared before they can
%  be used. The exceptions are the generic hooks for commands and
%  environments (executed at \cs{begin} and \cs{end}), and the
%  hooks run when loading files (see section~\ref{sec:generic}).
%
% \begin{function}{\NewHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{NewHook} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Creates a new \meta{hook}.
%    If this hook is declared within a package it is suggested
%    that its name is always structured as follows:
%    \meta{package-name}\texttt{/}\meta{hook-name}. If necessary you
%    can further subdivide the name by adding more \texttt{/} parts.
%    If a hook name is already taken, an error is raised and the hook
%    is not created.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\NewReversedHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{NewReversedHook} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%     Like \cs{NewHook} declares a new \meta{hook}.
%     the difference is that the code chunks for this hook are in
%     reverse order by default (those added last are executed first).
%     Any rules for the hook are applied after the default ordering.
%     See sections~\ref{sec:order} and \ref{sec:reversed-order}
%    for further details.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\NewMirroredHookPair}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{NewMirroredHookPair} \Arg{hook-1} \Arg{hook-2}
%   \end{syntax}
%     A shorthand for
%    \cs{NewHook}\Arg{hook-1}\cs{NewReversedHook}\Arg{hook-2}.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
%
% \begin{function}{\NewHookWithArguments}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{NewHookWithArguments} \Arg{hook} \Arg{number}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Creates a new \meta{hook} whose code takes \meta{number} arguments,
%   and otherwise works exactly like \cs{NewHook}.
%   Section~\ref{sec:hook-args} explains hooks with arguments.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\NewReversedHookWithArguments}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{NewReversedHookWithArguments} \Arg{hook} \Arg{number}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Like \cs{NewReversedHook}, but creates a hook whose code takes
%   \meta{number} arguments.
%   Section~\ref{sec:hook-args} explains hooks with arguments.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\NewMirroredHookPairWithArguments}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{NewMirroredHookPairWithArguments} \Arg{hook-1} \Arg{hook-2} \Arg{number}
%   \end{syntax}
%   A shorthand for
%   \cs{NewHookWithArguments}\Arg{hook-1}\Arg{number}\\
%   \cs{NewReversedHookWithArguments}\Arg{hook-2}\Arg{number}.
%   Section~\ref{sec:hook-args} explains hooks with arguments.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
%
% \subsubsection{Special declarations for generic hooks}
%
%    The declarations here should normally not be used. They are available
%    to provide support for special use cases mainly involving
%    generic command hooks.
%
% \changes{v1.0p}{2021/08/20}{Documentation updates for generic hook commands (gh/638)}
%
% \begin{function}{\DisableGenericHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{DisableGenericHook} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%    After this declaration\footnotemark{} the \meta{hook} is no longer
%    usable: Any further attempt to add code to it will result in an
%    error and any use, e.g., via \cs{UseHook}, will simply do nothing.
%
%    This is intended to be used with generic command hooks (see
%    \texttt{ltcmdhooks-doc}) as depending on the definition of the
%    command such generic hooks may be unusable. If that is known, a
%    package developer can disable such hooks up front.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}\footnotetext{In the 2020/06 release this command was
%    called \cs{DisableHook}, but that name was misleading as it
%    shouldn't be used to disable non-generic hooks.}
%
%
% \begin{function}{\ActivateGenericHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{ActivateGenericHook} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%    This declaration activates a generic hook provided by a package/class
%    (e.g., one used in code with \cs{UseHook} or
%    \cs{UseOneTimeHook}) without it being explicitly declared with
%    \cs{NewHook}).
%    This command undoes the effect of \cs{DisableGenericHook}.
%    If the hook is already activated, this command does nothing.
%
%    See section~\ref{sec:generic-hooks} for a discussion of when this
%    declaration is appropriate.
% \end{function}
%
%
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{Using hooks in code}
%
%
% \begin{function}{\UseHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{UseHook} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Execute the code stored in the \meta{hook}.
%
%    Before \verb=\begin{document}= the fast execution code for a hook
%    is not set up, so in order to use a hook there it is explicitly
%    initialized first. As that involves assignments using a hook at
%    those times is not 100\% the same as using it after
%    \verb=\begin{document}=.
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\UseHookWithArguments}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{UseHookWithArguments} \Arg{hook} \Arg{number} \Arg{arg_1} \ldots \Arg{arg_n}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Execute the code stored in the \meta{hook} and pass the arguments
%    \Arg{arg_1} through \Arg{arg_n} to the \meta{hook}.  Otherwise, it
%    works exactly like \cs{UseHook}.
%    The \meta{number} should be the number of arguments declared for
%    the hook.  If the hook is not declared, this command does nothing
%    and it will remove \meta{number} items from the input.
%   Section~\ref{sec:hook-args} explains hooks with arguments.
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\UseOneTimeHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{UseOneTimeHook} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Some hooks are only used (and can be only used) in one place, for
%    example, those in \verb=\begin{document}= or
%    \verb=\end{document}=. From that point onwards, adding to the hook
%    through a defined \cs[no-index]{\meta{addto-cmd}} command (e.g.,
%    \cs{AddToHook} or \cs{AtBeginDocument}, etc.\@) would have no
%    effect (as would the use of such a command inside the hook code
%    itself). It is therefore customary to redefine
%    \cs{\meta{addto-cmd}} to simply  process its argument, i.e.,
%    essentially make it behave like \cs{@firstofone}.
%
%    \cs{UseOneTimeHook} does that: it records that the hook has been
%    consumed and any further attempt to add to it will result in
%    executing the code to be added immediately.
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.    See
%    section~\ref{sec:default-label} for details.
%
%    Using \cs{UseOneTimeHook} several times with the same
%    \Arg{hook} means that it only executes the first time it is used.
%    For example, if it is used in a command that can be called several times
%    then the hook executes during only the \emph{first} invocation of that
%    command; this allows its use as an \enquote{initialization hook}.
%
%    Mixing \cs{UseHook} and \cs{UseOneTimeHook} for the same
%    \Arg{hook} should be avoided, but if this is done then neither will execute
%    after the first \cs{UseOneTimeHook}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\UseOneTimeHookWithArguments}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{UseOneTimeHookWithArguments} \Arg{hook} \Arg{number} \Arg{arg_1} \ldots \Arg{arg_n}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Works exactly like \cs{UseOneTimeHook}, but passes arguments
%    \Arg{arg_1} through \Arg{arg_n} to the \meta{hook}.
%    The \meta{number} should be the number of arguments declared for
%    the hook.  If the hook is not declared, this command does nothing
%    and it will remove \meta{number} items from the input.
%
%    It should be noted that after a one-time hook is used, it is no
%    longer possible to use \cs{AddToHookWithArguments} or similar with
%    that hook.  \cs{AddToHook} continues to work as normal.
%   Section~\ref{sec:hook-args} explains hooks with arguments.
% \end{function}
%
%
% \subsubsection{Updating code for hooks}
%
% \begin{function}{\AddToHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AddToHook} \Arg{hook}\oarg{label}\Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Adds \meta{code} to the \meta{hook} labeled by \meta{label}.
%    When the optional argument \meta{label} is not provided, the
%    \meta{default label} is used (see section~\ref{sec:default-label}).
%    If \cs{AddToHook} is used in a package/class, the
%    \meta{default label} is the package/class name, otherwise it is
%    \hook{top-level} (the \hook{top-level} label is treated
%    differently:  see section~\ref{sec:top-level}).
%
%    If there already exists code under the \meta{label} then the new
%    \meta{code} is appended to the existing one (even if this is a reversed hook).
%    If you want to replace existing code under the
%    \meta{label}, first apply \cs{RemoveFromHook}.
%
%    The hook doesn't have to exist for code to be added to
%    it. However, if it is not declared, then obviously the
%    added \meta{code} will never be executed.  This
%    allows for hooks to work regardless of package loading order and
%    enables packages to add to hooks from other packages without
%    worrying whether they are actually used in the current document.
%    See section~\ref{sec:querying}.
%
%    The \meta{hook} and \meta{label} can be specified using the
%    dot-syntax to denote the current package name.
%    See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\AddToHookWithArguments}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AddToHookWithArguments} \Arg{hook}\oarg{label}\Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Works exactly like \cs{AddToHook}, except that the \meta{code} can
%    access the arguments passed to the hook using \verb|#1|, \verb|#2|,
%    \ldots, \verb|#n| (up to the number of arguments declared for the
%    hook).  If the \meta{code} should contain \emph{parameter tokens}
%    (\verb|#|) that are not supposed to be understood as the arguments
%    of the hook, such tokens should be doubled.  For example, with
%    \cs{AddToHook} one can write:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \AddToHook{myhook}{\def\foo#1{Hello, #1!}}
%\end{verbatim}
%    but to achieve the same with \cs{AddToHookWithArguments}, one should
%    write:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \AddToHookWithArguments{myhook}{\def\foo##1{Hello, ##1!}}
%\end{verbatim}
%    because in the latter case, \verb|#1| refers to the first argument
%    of the hook \hook{myhook}.
%   Section~\ref{sec:hook-args} explains hooks with arguments.
%
%    The \meta{hook} and \meta{label} can be specified using the
%    dot-syntax to denote the current package name.
%    See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\RemoveFromHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{RemoveFromHook} \Arg{hook}\oarg{label}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Removes any code labeled by \meta{label} from the \meta{hook}.
%    When the optional argument \meta{label} is not provided, the
%    \meta{default label} is used (see section~\ref{sec:default-label}).
%
%    If there is no code under the \meta{label} in the \meta{hook},
%    or if the \meta{hook} does not exist, a warning is issued when
%    you attempt to \cs{RemoveFromHook}, and the command is ignored.
%    \cs{RemoveFromHook} should be used only when you know exactly what
%    labels are in a hook. Typically this will be when some code gets added to a hook 
%    by a package, then later this code is removed by that same package.
%    If you want to prevent the execution of code from another
%    package, use the |voids| rule instead (see section~\ref{sec:rules}).
%
%    If the optional \meta{label} argument is \texttt{*}, then all code chunks are
%    removed. This is rather dangerous as it may well drop code from other
%    packages (that one may not know about); it should therefore not be used
%    in packages but only in document preambles!
%
%    The \meta{hook} and \meta{label} can be specified using the
%    dot-syntax to denote the current package name.
%    See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \medskip
%
% In contrast to the \texttt{voids} relationship between two labels
% in a \cs{DeclareHookRule} this is a destructive operation as the
% labeled code is removed from the hook data structure, whereas the
% relationship setting can be undone by providing a different
% relationship later.
%
% A useful application for this declaration inside the document body
% is when one wants to temporarily add code to hooks and later remove
% it again, e.g.,
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \AddToHook{env/quote/before}{\small}
%   \begin{quote}
%     A quote set in a smaller typeface
%   \end{quote}
%   ...
%   \RemoveFromHook{env/quote/before}
%   ... now back to normal for further quotes
%\end{verbatim}
% Note that you can't cancel the setting with
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \AddToHook{env/quote/before}{}
%\end{verbatim}
% because that only \enquote{adds} a further empty chunk of code to
% the hook. Adding \cs{normalsize} would work but that means the hook
% then contained \cs{small}\cs{normalsize} which means two font size
% changes for no good reason.
%
% The above is only needed if one wants to typeset several quotes in a
% smaller typeface. If the hook is only needed once then
% \cs{AddToHookNext} is simpler, because it resets itself after one use.
%
%
% \begin{function}{\AddToHookNext}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AddToHookNext} \Arg{hook}\Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Adds \meta{code} to the next invocation of the \meta{hook}.
%    The code is executed after the normal hook code has finished and
%    it is executed only once, i.e. it is deleted after it was used.
%
%    Using this declaration is a global operation, i.e., the code is
%    not lost even if the declaration is used inside a group and the
%    next invocation of the hook happens after the end of that group. 
%    If the declaration is
%    used several times before the hook is executed then all code is
%    executed in the order in which it was declared.\footnotemark
%
%    If this declaration is used with a one-time hook then the code 
%    is only ever used if the declaration comes before the hook’s 
%    invocation.  This is because, in contrast 
%    to \cs{AddToHook}, the code in this declaration is not 
%    executed immediately in the case when the invocation of the hook
%    has already happened---in other words, this code will truly execute
%    only on the next invocation of the hook (and in the case of a
%    one-time hook there is no such \enquote{next invocation}).  
%    This gives you a choice: should my code execute
%    always, or should it execute only at the point where the
%    one-time hook is used (and not at all if this is impossible)? For
%    both of these possibilities there are use cases.
%
%    It is possible to nest this declaration using the same hook (or
%    different hooks): e.g.,
%   \begin{quote}
%     \cs{AddToHookNext}\Arg{hook}\verb={=\meta{code-1}^^A
%     \cs{AddToHookNext}\Arg{hook}\Arg{code-2}\verb=}=
%   \end{quote}
%    will execute \meta{code-1} next time the \meta{hook} is used and at
%    that point puts \meta{code-2} into  the \meta{hook} so that it gets
%    executed on following time the hook is run.
%
%    A hook doesn't have to exist for code to be added to it.  This
%    allows for hooks to work regardless of package loading
%    order.
%    See section~\ref{sec:querying}.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name.  See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}\footnotetext{There is
%    no mechanism to reorder such code chunks (or delete them).}
%
% \begin{function}{\AddToHookNextWithArguments}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AddToHookNextWithArguments} \Arg{hook}\Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Works exactly like \cs{AddToHookNext}, but the \meta{code} can
%    contain references to the arguments of the \meta{hook} as described
%    for \cs{AddToHookWithArguments} above.
%   Section~\ref{sec:hook-args} explains hooks with arguments.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name.  See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
%
%
% \begin{function}{\ClearHookNext}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{ClearHookNext}\Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Normally \cs{AddToHookNext} is only used when you know precisely
%    where it will apply and why you want some extra code at that
%    point. However, there are a few use cases in which such a
%    declaration needs to be canceled, for example, when
%    discarding a page with \cs{DiscardShipoutBox} (but even then not
%    always), and in such situations \cs{ClearHookNext} can be
%    used.
% \end{function}
%
%
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{Hook names and default labels}
% \label{sec:default-label}
%
% It is best practice to use \cs{AddToHook} in packages or classes
% \emph{without specifying a \meta{label}} because then the package
% or class name is automatically used, which is helpful if rules are
% needed, and avoids mistyping the \meta{label}.
%
% Using an explicit \meta{label} is only necessary in very specific
% situations, e.g., if you want to add several chunks of code into a
% single hook and have them placed in different parts of the hook
% (by providing some rules).
%
% The other case is when you develop a larger package with several
% sub-packages. In that case you may want to use the same
% \meta{label} throughout the sub-packages in order to avoid
% that the labels change if you internally reorganize your code.
%
% Except for \cs{UseHook}, \cs{UseOneTimeHook} and \cs{IfHookEmptyTF}
% (and their \pkg{expl3} interfaces \cs{hook_use:n},
% \cs{hook_use_once:n} and \cs{hook_if_empty:nTF}), all \meta{hook}
% and \meta{label} arguments are processed in the same way: first,
% spaces are trimmed around the argument, then it is fully expanded
% until only character tokens remain.  If the full expansion of the
% \meta{hook} or \meta{label} contains a non-expandable non-character
% token, a low-level \TeX{} error is raised (namely, the \meta{hook} is
% expanded using \TeX's \cs{csname}\ldots\cs{endcsname}, as such,
% Unicode characters are allowed in \meta{hook} and \meta{label}
% arguments).  The arguments of \cs{UseHook}, \cs{UseOneTimeHook}, and
% \cs{IfHookEmptyTF} are
% processed much in the same way except that spaces are not trimmed
% around the argument, for better performance.
%
% It is not enforced, but highly recommended that the hooks defined by
% a package, and the \meta{labels} used to add code to other hooks
% contain the package name to easily identify the source of the code
% chunk and to prevent clashes.  This should be the standard practice,
% so this hook management code provides a shortcut to refer to the
% current package in the name of a \meta{hook} and in a \meta{label}.
% If the \meta{hook} name or the \meta{label} consist just of a single dot
% (|.|), or starts with a dot followed by a slash (|./|) then the dot
% denotes the \meta{default label} (usually the current package or class
% name---see~\cs{SetDefaultHookLabel}).
% A \enquote{|.|} or \enquote{|./|} anywhere else in a \meta{hook} or in
% \meta{label} is treated literally and is not replaced.
%
% For example,
% inside the package \texttt{mypackage.sty}, the default label is
% \texttt{mypackage}, so the instructions:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \NewHook   {./hook}
%   \AddToHook {./hook}[.]{code}     % Same as \AddToHook{./hook}{code}
%   \AddToHook {./hook}[./sub]{code}
%   \DeclareHookRule{begindocument}{.}{before}{babel}
%   \AddToHook {file/foo.tex/after}{code}
% \end{verbatim}
%    are equivalent to:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \NewHook   {mypackage/hook}
%   \AddToHook {mypackage/hook}[mypackage]{code}
%   \AddToHook {mypackage/hook}[mypackage/sub]{code}
%   \DeclareHookRule{begindocument}{mypackage}{before}{babel}
%   \AddToHook {file/foo.tex/after}{code}                  % unchanged
% \end{verbatim}
%
% The \meta{default label} is automatically set equal to the name of the
% current package or class at the time the package is loaded.  If the
% hook command is used outside of a package, or the current file wasn't
% loaded with \cs{usepackage} or \cs{documentclass}, then the
% \texttt{top-level} is used as the \meta{default label}.  This may have
% exceptions---see \cs{PushDefaultHookLabel}.
%
% This syntax is available in all \meta{label} arguments and most
% \meta{hook} arguments, both in the \LaTeXe{} interface, and the \LaTeX3
% interface described in section~\ref{sec:l3hook-interface}.
%
% Note, however, that the replacement of |.| by the \meta{default label}
% takes place when the hook command is executed, so actions that are
% somehow executed after the package ends will have the wrong
% \meta{default label} if the dot-syntax is used.  For that reason,
% this syntax is not available in \cs{UseHook} (and \cs{hook_use:n})
% because the hook is most of the time used outside of the package file
% in which it was defined. This syntax is also not available in the hook
% conditionals \cs{IfHookEmptyTF} (and \cs{hook_if_empty:nTF}), because these
% conditionals are used in some performance-critical parts of the hook
% management code, and because they are usually used to refer to other
% package's hooks, so the dot-syntax doesn't make much sense.
%
% In some cases, for example in large packages, one may want to separate
% the code in logical parts, but still use the main package name as the
% \meta{label}, then the \meta{default label} can be set using
% \cs{PushDefaultHookLabel}\verb={...}=\,\ldots\cs{PopDefaultHookLabel}
% or \cs{SetDefaultHookLabel}\verb={...}=.
%
% \begin{function}{\PushDefaultHookLabel,\PopDefaultHookLabel}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{PushDefaultHookLabel} \Arg{default label}
%     \quad \meta{code}
%     \cs{PopDefaultHookLabel}
%   \end{syntax}
%   \cs{PushDefaultHookLabel} sets the current \meta{default label} to
%   be used in \meta{label} arguments, or when replacing a leading
%   ``|.|'' (see above).  \cs{PopDefaultHookLabel} reverts the
%   \meta{default label} to its previous value.
%
%   Inside a package or class, the \meta{default label} is equal to the
%   package or class name, unless explicitly changed.  Everywhere else,
%   the \meta{default label} is |top-level| (see
%   section~\ref{sec:top-level}) unless explicitly changed.
%
%   The effect of \cs{PushDefaultHookLabel} holds until the next
%   \cs{PopDefaultHookLabel}.  \cs{usepackage} (and \cs{RequirePackage}
%   and \cs{documentclass}) internally use
%   \begin{quote}
%     \cs{PushDefaultHookLabel}\Arg{package name} \\
%     \null \quad  \meta{package code} \\
%     \cs{PopDefaultHookLabel}
%   \end{quote}
%   to set the \meta{default label} for the package or class file.
%   Inside the \meta{package code} the \meta{default label} can also be
%   changed with \cs{SetDefaultHookLabel}.  \cs{input} and other
%   file input-related commands from the \LaTeX{} kernel do not use
%   \cs{PushDefaultHookLabel}, so code within files loaded by these
%   commands does \emph{not} get a dedicated \meta{label}! (that is, the
%   \meta{default label} is the current active one when the file was
%   loaded.)
%
%   Packages that provide their own package-like interfaces
%   (Ti\textit{k}Z's \cs{usetikzlibrary}, for example) can use
%   \cs{PushDefaultHookLabel} and \cs{PopDefaultHookLabel} to set
%   dedicated labels and to emulate \cs{usepackage}-like hook behavior
%   within those contexts.
%
%   The |top-level| label is treated differently, and is reserved to the
%   user document, so it is not allowed to change the
%   \meta{default label} to |top-level|.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\SetDefaultHookLabel}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{SetDefaultHookLabel} \Arg{default label}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Similarly to \cs{PushDefaultHookLabel},
%   sets the current \meta{default label} to
%   be used in \meta{label} arguments, or when replacing a leading
%   ``|.|''. The effect holds until the label is changed again or until
%   the next \cs{PopDefaultHookLabel}.  The difference between
%   \cs{PushDefaultHookLabel} and \cs{SetDefaultHookLabel} is that the
%   latter does not save the current \meta{default label}.
%
%   This command is useful when a large package is composed of several
%   smaller packages, but all should have the same \meta{label}, so
%   \cs{SetDefaultHookLabel} can be used at the beginning of each
%   package file to set the correct label.
%
%   \cs{SetDefaultHookLabel} is not allowed in the main document, where
%   the \meta{default label} is |top-level| and there is no
%   \cs{PopDefaultHookLabel} to end its effect.
%   It is also not allowed to change the \meta{default label} to
%   |top-level|.
% \end{function}
%
% \subsubsection{The \texttt{top-level} label}
% \label{sec:top-level}
%
% The |top-level| label, assigned to code added from the main document,
% is different from other labels.  Code added to hooks (usually
% \cs{AtBeginDocument}) in the preamble is almost always to change
% something defined by a package, so it should go at the very end of the
% hook.
%
% Therefore, code added in the |top-level| is always executed at the end
% of the hook, regardless of where it was declared.  If the hook is
% reversed (see \cs{NewReversedHook}), the |top-level| chunk is executed
% at the very beginning instead.
%
% Rules regarding |top-level| have no effect:  if a user wants to have a
% specific set of rules for a code chunk, they should use a different
% label to said code chunk, and provide a rule for that label instead.
%
% The |top-level| label is exclusive for the user, so trying to add code
% with that label from a package results in an error.
%
% \subsubsection{Defining relations between hook code}
% \label{sec:rules}
%
% The default assumption is that code added to hooks by different
% packages are independent and the order in which they are executed is
% irrelevant. While this is true in many cases it is obviously false
% in others.
%
% Before the hook management system was introduced
% packages had to take elaborate precaution to determine of some other
% package got loaded as well (before or after) and find some ways to
% alter its behavior accordingly. In addition is was often the user's
% responsibility to load packages in the right order so that code
% added to hooks got added in the right order and some cases even
% altering the loading order wouldn't resolve the conflicts.
%
% With the new hook management system it is now possible to define
% rules (i.e., relationships) between code chunks added by different
% packages and explicitly describe in which order they should be
% processed.
%
% \begin{function}{\DeclareHookRule}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{DeclareHookRule} \Arg{hook}\Arg{label1}\Arg{relation}\Arg{label2}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Defines a relation between \meta{label1} and \meta{label2} for a
%    given \meta{hook}. If \meta{hook} is \texttt{??} this defines a default
%    relation for all hooks that use the two labels, i.e., that have
%    chunks of code labeled with \meta{label1} and \meta{label2}.
%    Rules specific to a given hook take precedence over default
%    rules that use \texttt{??} as the \meta{hook}.
%
%    Currently, the supported relations are the following:
%    \begin{itemize}
%
%    \item[\texttt{before} or \texttt{\string<}]
%
%      Code for \meta{label1} comes before code for \meta{label2}.
%
%    \item[\texttt{after} or \texttt{\string>}]
%      Code for \meta{label1} comes after code for \meta{label2}.
%
%    \item[\texttt{incompatible-warning}]
%
%      Only code for either \meta{label1} or \meta{label2} can appear
%      for that hook (a way to say that two packages---or parts of
%      them---are incompatible). A warning is raised if both labels
%      appear in the same hook.
%
%    \item[\texttt{incompatible-error}]
%
%      Like \texttt{incompatible-error} but instead of a warning a
%      \LaTeX{} error is raised, and the code for both labels are
%      dropped from that hook until the conflict is resolved.
%
%    \item[\texttt{voids}]
%
%      Code for \meta{label1} overwrites code for \meta{label2}. More
%      precisely, code for \meta{label2} is dropped for that
%      hook. This can be used, for example if one package is a
%      superset in functionality of another one and therefore wants to
%      undo code in some hook and replace it with its own version.
%
%    \item[\texttt{unrelated}]
%
%       The order of code for \meta{label1} and \meta{label2} is
%      irrelevant. This rule is there to undo an incorrect rule
%      specified earlier.
%
%    \end{itemize}
%    There can only be a single relation between two labels for a
%    given hook,
%    i.e., a later \cs{DeclareHookrule} overwrites any previous
%    declaration.
%
%    The \meta{hook} and \meta{label} can be specified using the
%    dot-syntax to denote the current package name.
%    See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
%
% \end{function}
%
%
% \begin{function}{\ClearHookRule}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{ClearHookRule}\Arg{hook}\Arg{label1}\Arg{label2}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Syntactic sugar for saying that \meta{label1} and \meta{label2}
%    are unrelated for the given \meta{hook}.
% \end{function}
%
%
%
% \begin{function}{\DeclareDefaultHookRule}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{DeclareDefaultHookRule}\Arg{label1}\Arg{relation}\Arg{label2}
%   \end{syntax}
%   This sets up a relation between \meta{label1} and \meta{label2}
%    for all hooks unless overwritten by a specific rule for a hook.
%    Useful for cases where one package has a specific relation to
%    some other package, e.g., is \texttt{incompatible} or always
%    needs a special ordering \texttt{before} or \texttt{after}.
%    (Technically it is just a shorthand for using \cs{DeclareHookRule}
%    with \texttt{??} as the hook name.)
%
%    Declaring default rules is only supported in the document
%    preamble.\footnotemark{}
%
%    The \meta{label} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}\footnotetext{Trying to do so, e.g., via
%    \cs{DeclareHookRule} with \texttt{??}  has bad side-effects and
%    is not supported (though not explicitly caught for performance
%    reasons).}
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{Querying hooks}
% \label{sec:querying}
%
% Simpler data types, like token lists, have three possible states; they
% can:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item exist and be empty;
%   \item exist and be non-empty; and
%   \item not exist (in which case emptiness doesn't apply);
% \end{itemize}
% Hooks are a bit more complicated:
% a hook may exist or not, and independently it may or may not be empty.
% This means that even a hook that doesn't exist may be non-empty and
%    it can also be disabled.
%
% This seemingly strange state may happen when, for example, package~$A$
% defines hook \hook{A/foo}, and package $B$ adds some code to that
% hook.  However, a document may load package $B$ before package $A$, or
% may not load package $A$ at all.  In both cases some code is added to
% hook \hook{A/foo} without that hook being defined yet, thus that
% hook is said to be non-empty, whereas it doesn't exist.  Therefore,
% querying the existence of a hook doesn't imply its emptiness, neither
% does the other way around.
%
% Given that code or rules can be added to a hook even if it doesn't
% physically exist yet, means that a querying its existence has no
% real use case (in contrast to other variables that can only be
% update if they have already been declared). For that reason only the
% test for emptiness has a public interface.
%
% A hook is said to be empty when no code was added to it, either to
% its permanent code pool, or to its ``next'' token list.  The hook
% doesn't need to be declared to have code added to its code pool.
% A hook is said to exist when it was declared with \cs{NewHook} or
% some variant thereof.  Generic hooks such as \hook{file} and \hook{env} hooks are
% automatically declared when code is added to them.
%
% \begin{function}[EXP]{\IfHookEmptyTF}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{IfHookEmptyTF} \Arg{hook} \Arg{true code} \Arg{false code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Tests if the \meta{hook} is empty (\emph{i.e.}, no code was added to
%   it using either \cs{AddToHook} or \cs{AddToHookNext}) or such code
%    was removed again (via \cs{RemoveFromHook}), and
%   branches to either \meta{true code} or \meta{false code} depending
%   on the result.
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.
% \end{function}
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{Displaying hook code}
%
%    If one has to adjust the code execution in a hook using a hook
%    rule it is helpful to get some information about the code
%    associated with a hook, its current order and the existing rules.
%
% \begin{function}{\ShowHook,\LogHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{ShowHook} \Arg{hook}
%     \cs{LogHook}  \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Displays information about the \meta{hook} such as
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%      the code chunks (and their labels) added to it,
%   \item
%      any rules set up to order them,
%   \item
%      the computed order in which the chunks are executed,
%   \item
%      any code executed on the next invocation only.
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{function}
%
%   \cs{LogHook} prints the information to the |.log| file, and
%   \cs{ShowHook} prints them to the terminal/command window and starts
%   \TeX's prompt (only in \cs{errorstopmode}) to wait for user action.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
%
%^^A   % Code for the listing below:
%^^A   \NewHook{example-hook}
%^^A   \AddToHook{example-hook}{[code from 'top-level']}
%^^A   \AddToHook{example-hook}[foo]{[code from package 'foo']}
%^^A   \AddToHook{example-hook}[bar]{[from package 'bar']}
%^^A   \AddToHook{example-hook}[baz]{[package 'baz' is here]}
%^^A   \AddToHookNext{example-hook}{[one-time code]}
%^^A   \DeclareHookRule{example-hook}{baz}{before}{foo}
%^^A   \DeclareDefaultHookRule{bar}{after}{baz}
%^^A   \ShowHook{example-hook}
%
%   \def\theFancyVerbLine{\textcolor[gray]{0.5}{%^^A
%     \sffamily\tiny\arabic{FancyVerbLine}}}
%
%   \bigskip
%   Suppose a hook \texttt{example-hook} whose output of
%   \cs{ShowHook}|{example-hook}| is:
%   \begin{verbatim}[numbers=left]
%   -> The hook 'example-hook':
%   > Code chunks:
%   >     foo -> [code from package 'foo']
%   >     bar -> [from package 'bar']
%   >     baz -> [package 'baz' is here]
%   > Document-level (top-level) code (executed last):
%   >     -> [code from 'top-level']
%   > Extra code for next invocation:
%   >     -> [one-time code]
%   > Rules:
%   >     foo|baz with relation >
%   >     baz|bar with default relation <
%   > Execution order (after applying rules):
%   >     baz, foo, bar.
%   \end{verbatim}
%
%   In the listing above, lines~3 to~5 show the three code chunks added
%   to the hook and their respective labels in the format
%   \begin{quote}
%   \quad \meta{label}\verb| -> |\meta{code}
%   \end{quote}
%
%   Line~7 shows the code chunk added by the user in the main document
%   (labeled |top-level|) in the format
%   \begin{quote}
%   \quad\verb|Document-level (top-level) code (executed |%^^A
%              \meta{first\texttt{\string|}last}\verb|):|\\
%   \quad\verb|    -> |\meta{\texttt{top-level} code}
%   \end{quote}
%   This code will be either the first or last code executed by the hook
%   (|last| if the hook is normal, |first| if it is reversed).  This
%   chunk is not affected by rules and does not take part in sorting.
%
%   Line~9 shows the code chunk for the next execution of the hook in
%   the format
%   \begin{quote}
%   \quad \verb|-> |\meta{next-code}
%   \end{quote}
%   This code will be used and disappear at the next
%   \verb|\UseHook{example-hook}|, in contrast to the chunks mentioned
%   earlier, which can only be removed from that hook by doing
%   \verb|\RemoveFromHook{|\meta{label}|}[example-hook]|.
%
%   Lines~11 and~12 show the rules declared that affect this hook in the
%   format
%   \begin{quote}
%   \quad \meta{label-1}\verb+|+\meta{label-2}| with |%^^A
%         \meta{\texttt{default}?}| relation |\meta{relation}
%   \end{quote}
%   which means that the \meta{relation} applies to \meta{label-1} and
%   \meta{label-2}, in that order, as detailed in \cs{DeclareHookRule}.
%   If the relation is \texttt{default} it means that this rule applies
%   to \meta{label-1} and \meta{label-2} in \emph{all} hooks, (unless
%   overridden by a non-default relation).
%
%   Finally, line~14 lists the labels in the hook after sorting;
%   that is, in the order they will be executed when the hook is used.
%
%
% \subsubsection{Debugging hook code}
%
% \begin{function}{\DebugHooksOn,\DebugHooksOff}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{DebugHooksOn}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Turn the debugging of hook code on or off. This displays most changes
%    made to the hook data structures. The output is rather coarse and
%      not really intended for normal use.
% \end{function}
%
%
% \subsection{L3 programming layer (\texttt{expl3}) interfaces}
% \label{sec:l3hook-interface}
%
%
% This is a quick summary of the \LaTeX3 programming interfaces for
% use with packages written in \texttt{expl3}. In contrast to the
% \LaTeXe{} interfaces they always use mandatory arguments only, e.g.,
% you always have to specify the \meta{label} for a code chunk.  We
% therefore suggest to use the declarations discussed in the previous
% section even in \texttt{expl3} packages, but the choice is yours.
%
%
% \begin{function}{
%     \hook_new:n,
%     \hook_new_reversed:n,
%     \hook_new_pair:nn
%   }
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_new:n} \Arg{hook}
%     \cs{hook_new_reversed:n} \Arg{hook}
%     \cs{hook_new_pair:nn} \Arg{hook-1} \Arg{hook-2}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Creates a new \meta{hook} with normal or reverse ordering of code
%    chunks. \cs{hook_new_pair:nn} creates a pair of such hooks with
%    \Arg{hook-2} being a reversed hook.
%    If a hook name is already taken, an error is raised and the hook
%    is not created.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{
%     \hook_new_with_args:nn,
%     \hook_new_reversed_with_args:nn,
%     \hook_new_pair_with_args:nnn
%   }
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_new_with_args:nn} \Arg{hook} \Arg{number}
%     \cs{hook_new_reversed_with_args:nn} \Arg{hook} \Arg{number}
%     \cs{hook_new_pair_with_args:nnn} \Arg{hook-1} \Arg{hook-2} \Arg{number}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Creates a new \meta{hook} with normal or reverse ordering of code
%    chunks, that takes \meta{number} arguments from the input stream
%    when it is used. \cs{hook_new_pair_with_args:nn} creates a pair of
%    such hooks with \Arg{hook-2} being a reversed hook.
%    If a hook name is already taken, an error is raised and the hook
%    is not created.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
%
%
% \begin{function}{\hook_disable_generic:n}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_disable_generic:n} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Marks \Arg{hook} as disabled. Any further attempt to add code to
%    it or declare it, will result in an error and any call to
%    \cs{hook_use:n} will simply do nothing.
%
%    This declaration is intended for use with generic hooks that are
%    known not to work (see \texttt{ltcmdhooks-doc}) if they receive
%    code.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\hook_activate_generic:n}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_activate_generic:n} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%    This is like \cs{hook_new:n} but it does nothing if the hook was previously
%    declared with \cs{hook_new:n}.  This declaration should be used
%    only in special situations, e.g., when a command from another package
%    needs to be altered and it is not clear whether a
%    generic \hook{cmd} hook (for that command) has been previously 
%    explicitly declared.
%
%    Normally \cs{hook_new:n} should be used instead of this.
% \end{function}

%     \cs{hook_use:nnw} \Arg{hook} \Arg{number} \Arg{arg_1} \ldots \Arg{arg_n}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Executes the \Arg{hook} code followed (if set up) by the code for next
%    invocation only, then empties that next invocation code.
%    \cs{hook_use:nnw} should be used for hooks declared with arguments,
%    and should be followed by as many brace groups as the declared
%    number of arguments.
%    The \meta{number} should be the number of arguments declared for
%    the hook.  If the hook is not declared, this command does nothing
%    and it will remove \meta{number} items from the input.
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\hook_use_once:n,\hook_use_once:nnw}

%     \cs{hook_use_once:nnw} \Arg{hook} \Arg{number} \Arg{arg_1} \ldots \Arg{arg_n}
%   \end{syntax}
%     Changes the \Arg{hook} status so that from now on any addition to

%
% \subsection{On the order of hook code execution} \label{sec:order}
%
%    Chunks of code for a \meta{hook} under different labels are supposed
%    to be independent if there are no special rules set up that
%    define a relation between the chunks. This means that you can't
%    make assumptions about the order of execution!
%
%    Suppose you have the following declarations:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \NewHook{myhook}
%    \AddToHook{myhook}[packageA]{\typeout{A}}
%    \AddToHook{myhook}[packageB]{\typeout{B}}
%    \AddToHook{myhook}[packageC]{\typeout{C}}
%\end{verbatim}
%    then executing the hook with \cs{UseHook} will produce the
%    typeout \texttt{A} \texttt{B} \texttt{C} in that order.  In other
%    words, the execution order is computed to be \texttt{packageA},
%    \texttt{packageB}, \texttt{packageC} which you can verify with
%    \cs{ShowHook}\texttt{\{myhook\}}:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    -> The hook 'myhook':
%    > Code chunks:
%    >     packageA -> \typeout {A}
%    >     packageB -> \typeout {B}
%    >     packageC -> \typeout {C}
%    > Document-level (top-level) code (executed last):
%    >     ---
%    > Extra code for next invocation:
%    >     ---
%    > Rules:
%    >     ---
%    > Execution order:
%    >     packageA, packageB, packageC.
%\end{verbatim}
%    The reason is that the code chunks are internally saved in a property list
%    and the initial order of such a property list is the order in
%    which key-value pairs got added. However, that is only true if
%    nothing other than adding happens!
%
%    Suppose, for example, you want to replace the code chunk for
%    \texttt{packageA}, e.g.,
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \RemoveFromHook{myhook}[packageA]
%    \AddToHook{myhook}[packageA]{\typeout{A alt}}
%\end{verbatim}
%    then your order becomes  \texttt{packageB},
%    \texttt{packageC}, \texttt{packageA} because the label got removed
%    from the property list and then re-added (at its end).
%
%    While that may not be too surprising,  the execution order is
%    also sometimes altered if you add a redundant rule, e.g. if you specify
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \DeclareHookRule{myhook}{packageA}{before}{packageB}
%\end{verbatim}
%    instead of the previous lines we get
%\begin{verbatim}
%    -> The hook 'myhook':
%    > Code chunks:
%    >     packageA -> \typeout {A}
%    >     packageB -> \typeout {B}
%    >     packageC -> \typeout {C}
%    > Document-level (top-level) code (executed last):
%    >     ---
%    > Extra code for next invocation:
%    >     ---
%    > Rules:
%    >     packageB|packageA with relation >
%    > Execution order (after applying rules):
%    >     packageA, packageC, packageB.
%\end{verbatim}
%    As you can see the code chunks are still in the same order, but
%    in the execution order for the labels \texttt{packageB} and
%    \texttt{packageC} have
%    swapped places.
%    The reason is that, with the rule there are two orders that
%    satisfy it, and the algorithm for sorting happened to pick a
%    different one compared to the case without rules (where it
%    doesn't run at all as there is nothing to resolve).
%    Incidentally, if we had instead specified the redundant rule
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \DeclareHookRule{myhook}{packageB}{before}{packageC}
%\end{verbatim}
%    the execution order would not have changed.
%
%    In summary: it is not possible to rely on the order of execution
%    unless there are rules that partially or fully define the order
%    (in which you can rely on them being fulfilled).
%
%
% \subsection{The use of \enquote{reversed} hooks} \label{sec:reversed-order}
%
%    You may have wondered why you can declare a \enquote{reversed} hook
%    with \cs{NewReversedHook} and what that does exactly.
%
%    In short: the execution order of a reversed hook (without any
%    rules!) is exactly reversed to the order you would have gotten for
%    a hook declared with \cs{NewHook}.
%
%    This is helpful if you have a pair of hooks where you expect to see
%    code added that involves grouping, e.g., starting an environment
%    in the first and closing that environment in the second hook.
%    To give a somewhat contrived example\footnote{there are simpler
%    ways to achieve the same effect.}, suppose there is a package
%    adding the following:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \AddToHook{env/quote/before}[package-1]{\begin{itshape}}
%    \AddToHook{env/quote/after} [package-1]{\end{itshape}}
%\end{verbatim}
%    As a result, all quotes will be in italics.
%    Now suppose further that another |package-too| makes the quotes
%    also in blue and therefore adds:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage{color}
%    \AddToHook{env/quote/before}[package-too]{\begin{color}{blue}}
%    \AddToHook{env/quote/after} [package-too]{\end{color}}
%\end{verbatim}
%    Now if the \hook{env/quote/after} hook would be a normal hook we
%    would get the same execution order in  both hooks, namely:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    package-1, package-too
%\end{verbatim}
%    (or vice versa) and as a result, would get:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \begin{itshape}\begin{color}{blue} ...
%    \end{itshape}\end{color}
%\end{verbatim}
%    and an error message saying that \verb=\begin{color}= was ended by
%    \verb=\end{itshape}=.
%    With \hook{env/quote/after} declared as a reversed hook the
%    execution order is reversed and so all environments are closed in
%    the correct sequence and \cs{ShowHook} would give us the
%    following output:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    -> The hook 'env/quote/after':
%    > Code chunks:
%    >     package-1 -> \end {itshape}
%    >     package-too -> \end {color}
%    > Document-level (top-level) code (executed first):
%    >     ---
%    > Extra code for next invocation:
%    >     ---
%    > Rules:
%    >     ---
%    > Execution order (after reversal):
%    >     package-too, package-1.
%\end{verbatim}
%
%    The reversal of the execution order happens before applying any
%    rules, so if you alter the order you will probably have to alter
%    it in both hooks, not just in one, but that depends on the use case.
%
%
%
%
% \subsection{Difference between \enquote{normal} and
%    \enquote{one-time} hooks}
% \label{sec:onetime-hooks}
%
%    When executing a hook a developer has the choice of using
%    either \cs{UseHook} or \cs{UseOneTimeHook} (or their \pkg{expl3}
%    equivalents \cs{hook_use:n} and \cs{hook_use_once:n}).
%    This choice affects how \cs{AddToHook} is handled after the hook
%    has been executed for the first time.
%
%    With normal hooks adding code via \cs{AddToHook} means that the
%    code chunk is added to the hook data structure and then used each time
%    \cs{UseHook} is called.
%
%    With one-time hooks it this is handled slightly differently:
%    After \cs{UseOneTimeHook} has been called, any further attempts to
%    add code to the hook via \cs{AddToHook} will simply execute the
%    \meta{code} immediately.
%
%    This has some consequences one needs to be aware of:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item
%
%      If \meta{code} is added to a normal hook after the hook was
%      executed and it is never executed again for one or the other
%      reason, then this new \meta{code} will never be executed.
%
%    \item
%
%      In contrast if that happens with a one-time hook the \meta{code} is
%      executed immediately.
%
%    \end{itemize}
%    In particular this means that construct such as
%\begin{quote}
%    \cs{AddToHook}\verb={myhook}=\\
%    \phantom{\cs{AddToHook}}\verb={= \meta{code-1}
%                                     \cs{AddToHook}\verb={myhook}=\Arg{code-2}
%                                     \meta{code-3} \verb=}=
%\end{quote}
%    works for one-time hooks\footnote{This is sometimes used with
%    \cs{AtBeginDocument} which is why it is supported.} (all three
%    code chunks are executed one after another), but it makes little
%    sense with a normal hook, because with a normal hook the first time
%    \verb=\UseHook{myhook}= is executed it would
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item
%       execute \meta{code-1},
%    \item
%       then execute \verb=\AddToHook{myhook}{code-2}= which adds the
%    code chunk \meta{code-2} to the hook for use on the next invocation,
%    \item
%       and finally execute \meta{code-3}.
%    \end{itemize}
%    The second time \cs{UseHook} is called it would execute the
%    above and in addition \meta{code-2} as that was added as a code
%    chunk to the hook in the meantime. So each time the hook is used
%    another copy of \meta{code-2} is added and so that code chunk
%    is executed $\meta{\# of invocations} -1$ times.
%
%
%
% \subsection{Generic hooks provided by packages}
% \label{sec:generic-hooks}
%
% \changes{v1.0p}{2021/08/20}{Section on generic hooks added (gh/638)}
%
%    The hook management system also implements a category of hooks
%    that are called \enquote{Generic Hooks}. Normally a hook has to
%    be explicitly declared before it can be used in code. This
%    ensures that different packages are not using the same hook name
%    for unrelated purposes---something that would result in absolute
%    chaos.  However, there are a number of \enquote{standard} hooks
%    where it is unreasonable to declare them beforehand, e.g, each
%    and every command has (in theory) an associated \texttt{before}
%    and \texttt{after} hook. In such cases, i.e., for command,
%    environment or file hooks, they can be used simply by adding code
%    to them with \cs{AddToHook}. For more specialized generic hooks,
%    e.g., those provided by \pkg{babel}, you have to additionally
%    enable them with \cs{ActivateGenericHook} as explained below.
%
%    The generic hooks provided by \LaTeX{} are those for
%    \hook{cmd},
%    \hook{env},
%    \hook{file},
%    \hook{include}
%    \hook{package}, and
%    \hook{class},
%    and all these are available out of the box: you only have to 
%    use \cs{AddToHook} to
%    add code to them, but you don't have to add \cs{UseHook} or
%    \cs{UseOneTimeHook} to your code, because this is already done for
%    you (or, in the case of \hook{cmd} hooks, the command’s code is
%    patched at \verb=\begin{document}=, if necessary).
%
%    However, if you want to provide further generic hooks in your own
%    code, the situation is slightly different. To do this you should 
%    use \cs{UseHook} or \cs{UseOneTimeHook}, but
%    \emph{without declaring the hook} with \cs{NewHook}.  As
%    mentioned earlier, a call to \cs{UseHook} with an undeclared hook
%    name does nothing. So as an additional setup step, you need to
%    explicitly activate your generic hook.  Note that a generic hook
%    produced in this way is always a normal hook.
%
%    For a truly generic hook, with a variable part in the hook name,
%    such upfront activation would be difficult or impossible, because
%    you typically do not know what kind of variable parts may come up
%    in real documents.
%
%    For example, \pkg{babel} provides hooks such as
%    \hook{babel/\meta{language}/afterextras}.  However, language
%    support in \pkg{babel} is often done through external language
%    packages. Thus doing the activation for all languages inside the
%    core \pkg{babel} code is not a viable approach. Instead it needs
%    to be done by each language package (or by the user who wants to
%    use a particular hook).
%
%    Because the hooks are not declared with \cs{NewHook} their names
%    should be carefully chosen to ensure that they are (likely to be)
%    unique. Best practice is to include the package or
%    command name, as was done in the \pkg{babel} example above.
%
%    Generic hooks defined in this way are always normal hooks (i.e.,
%    you can't implement reversed hooks this way). This is a
%    deliberate limitation, because it speeds up the processessing
%    conciderably.
%
%
% \subsection{Hooks with arguments}
% \label{sec:hook-args}
%
%    Sometimes it is necessary to pass contextual information to a hook,
%    and, for one reason or another, it is not feasible to store such
%    information in macros.  To serve this purpose, hooks can be
%    declared with arguments, so that the programmer can pass along the
%    data necessary for the code in the hook to function properly.
%
%    A hook with arguments works mostly like a regular hook, and most
%    commands that work for regular hooks, also work for hooks that take
%    arguments.  The differences are when the hook is declared
%    (\cs{NewHookWithArguments} is used instead of \cs{NewHook}), then
%    code can be added with both \cs{AddToHook} and
%    \cs{AddToHookWithArguments}, and when the hook is used
%    (\cs{UseHookWithArguments} instead of \cs{UseHook}).
%
%    \medskip
%
%    A hook with arguments must be declared as such (before it is first
%    used, as all regular hooks) using
%    \cs{NewHookWithArguments}\Arg{hook}\Arg{number}.  All code added to
%    that hook can then use \verb|#1| to access the first argument,
%    \verb|#2| to access the second, and so forth up to the number of
%    arguments declared.  However, it is still possible to add code with
%    references to the arguments of a hook that was not yet declared
%    (we will discuss that later).  At their core, hooks are macros, so
%    \TeX's limit of 9~arguments applies, and a low-level \TeX{} error
%    is raised if you try to reference an argument number that doesn't
%    exist.
%
%    \medskip
%
%    To use a hook with arguments, just write
%    \cs{UseHookWithArguments}\Arg{hook}\Arg{number} followed by a
%    braced list of the arguments.  For example, if the hook \hook{test}
%    takes three arguments, write:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \UseHookWithArguments{test}{3}{arg-1}{arg-2}{arg-3}
%\end{verbatim}
%    then, in the \meta{code} of the hook, all instances of \verb|#1|
%    will be replaced by \verb|arg-1|, \verb|#2| by \verb|arg-2| and so
%    on.  If, at the point of usage, the programmer provides more
%    arguments than the hook is declared to take, the excess arguments
%    are simply ignored by the hook.  Behaviour is
%    unpredictable\footnote
%      {The hook \emph{will} take the declared number of arguments, and
%       what will happen depends on what was grabbed, and what the hook
%       code does with its arguments.}
%    if too few arguments are provided.  If the hook isn't declared,
%    \meta{number} arguments are removed from the input stream.
%
%    \medskip
%
%    Adding code to a hook with arguments can be done with
%    \cs{AddToHookWithArguments} as well as with the regular
%    \cs{AddToHook}, to achieve different outcomes.  The main difference
%    when it comes to adding code to a hook, in this case, is firstly
%    the possibility of accessing a hook's arguments, of course, and
%    second, how parameter tokens (\verb|#|$_6$) are treated.
%
%    Using \cs{AddToHook} in a hook that takes arguments will work as it
%    does for all other hooks. This allows a package developer to add
%    arguments to a hook that otherwise had none without having to worry
%    about compatibility.  This means that, for example:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \AddToHook{test}{\def\foo#1{Hello, #1!}}
%\end{verbatim}
%    will define the same macro \cs[no-index]{foo} regardless if the
%    hook \hook{test} takes arguments or not.
%
%    Using \cs{AddToHookWithArguments} allows the \meta{code} added to
%    access the arguments of the hook with \verb|#1|, \verb|#2|, and so
%    forth, up to the number of the arguments declared in the hook.
%    This means that if one wants to add a \verb|#|$_6$ to the
%    \meta{code} that token must be doubled in the input.  The same
%    definition from above, using \cs{AddToHookWithArguments}, needs to
%    be rewritten:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \AddToHookWithArguments{test}{\def\foo##1{Hello, ##1!}}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%    Extending the above example to use the hook arguments, we could
%    rewrite something like (now from declaration to usage, to get the
%    whole picture):
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \NewHookWithArguments{test}{1}
%    \AddToHookWithArguments{test}{%
%      \typeout{Defining foo with "#1"}
%      \def\foo##1{Hello, ##1! Some text after: #1}%
%    }
%    \UseHook{test}{Howdy!}
%    \ShowCommand\foo
%\end{verbatim}
%    Running the code above prints in the terminal:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    Defining foo with "Howdy!"
%    > \foo=macro:
%    #1->Hello, #1! Some text after: Howdy!.
%\end{verbatim}
%    Note how \verb|##1| in the call to \cs{AddToHookWithArguments}
%    became \verb|#1|, and the \verb|#1| was replaced by the argument
%    passed to the hook.  Should the hook be used again, with a
%    different argument, the definition would naturally change.
%
%    \bigskip
%
%    It is possible to add code referencing a hook's arguments before
%    such hook is declared and the number of hooks is fixed.  However,
%    if some code is added to the hook, that references more arguments
%    than will be declared for the hook, there will be a low-level
%    \TeX{} error about an \enquote{Illegal parameter number} at the
%    time the hook is declared, which will be hard to track down because
%    at that point \TeX{} can't know whence the offending code came
%    from.  Thus it is important that package writers explicitly
%    document how many arguments (if any) each hook can take, so users
%    of those packages know how many arguments can be referenced, and
%    equally important, what each argument means.
%
% \subsection{Private \LaTeX{} kernel hooks}
%
%    There are a few places where it is absolutely essential for
%    \LaTeX{} to function correctly that code is executed in a precisely
%    defined order. Even that could have been implemented with the
%    hook management (by adding various rules to ensure the
%    appropriate ordering with respect to other code added by
%    packages). However, this makes every document unnecessary
%    slow, because there has to be sorting even though the result is
%    predetermined. Furthermore it forces package writers to
%    unnecessarily add such rules if they add further code to the hook
%    (or break \LaTeX{}).
%
%    For that reason such code is not using the hook management, but
%    instead private kernel commands directly before or after a public
%    hook with the following naming
%    convention: \cs{@kernel@before@\meta{hook}} or
%    \cs{@kernel@after@\meta{hook}}. For example, in
%    \cs{enddocument} you find
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \UseHook{enddocument}%
%   \@kernel@after@enddocument
%\end{verbatim}
%    which means first the user/package-accessible \hook{enddocument}
%    hook is executed and then the internal kernel hook. As their name
%    indicates these kernel commands should not be altered by third-party
%    packages, so please refrain from that in the interest of
%    stability and instead use the public hook next to it.\footnote{As
%    with everything in \TeX{} there is not enforcement of this rule,
%    and by looking at the code it is easy to find out how the kernel
%    adds to them. The main reason of this section is therefore to say
%    \enquote{please don't do that, this is unconfigurable code!}}
%
%
%
% \subsection{Legacy \LaTeXe{} interfaces}
%
% \newcommand\onetimetext{This is a one-time hook, so after it
%   is executed, all further
%   attempts to add code to it will execute such code immediately
%   (see section~\ref{sec:onetime-hooks}).}
%
%  \LaTeXe{} offered a small number of hooks together with commands to
%    add to them. They are listed here and are retained for backwards
%    compatibility.
%
%  With the new hook management, several additional hooks have been added
%    to \LaTeX\ and more will follow. See the next section for what
%    is already available.
%
%
% \begin{function}{\AtBeginDocument}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AtBeginDocument} \oarg{label} \Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   If used without the optional argument \meta{label}, it works essentially
%    like before, i.e., it is adding \meta{code} to the hook
%    \hook{begindocument}
%    (which is executed inside \verb=\begin{document}=).
%    However, all code added this way is labeled with the label
%    \hook{top-level} (see section~\ref{sec:top-level})
%    if done outside of a package or class or with the
%    package/class name if called inside such a file
%    (see section~\ref{sec:default-label}).
%
%    This way one can add code to the hook using
%    \cs{AddToHook} or \cs{AtBeginDocument} using a different label
%    and explicitly order the code chunks as necessary, e.g., run some
%    code before or after another package's code.  When using the
%    optional argument the call is equivalent to running
%    \cs{AddToHook} \texttt{\{begindocument\}} \oarg{label}
%    \Arg{code}.
%
%    \cs{AtBeginDocument} is a wrapper around the \hook{begindocument}
%    hook (see section~\ref{sec:begindocument-hooks}), which is a
%    one-time hook.  As such, after the \hook{begindocument} hook is
%    executed at \verb=\begin{document}= any attempt to add \meta{code}
%    to this hook with \cs{AtBeginDocument} or with \cs{AddToHook} will
%    cause that \meta{code} to execute immediately instead.
%    See section~\ref{sec:onetime-hooks} for more on one-time hooks.
%
%    For important packages with known order requirement we may over
%    time add rules to the kernel (or to those packages) so that they
%    work regardless of the loading-order in the document.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\AtEndDocument}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AtEndDocument} \oarg{label} \Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Like \cs{AtBeginDocument} but for the \hook{enddocument} hook.
% \end{function}
%
%    \bigskip
%
%    The few hooks that existed previously in \LaTeXe{} used internally
%    commands such as \cs{@begindocumenthook} and packages sometimes
%    augmented them directly rather than working through
%    \cs{AtBeginDocument}. For that reason there is currently support
%    for this, that is, if the system detects that such an internal
%    legacy hook command contains code it adds it to the new hook
%    system under the label \texttt{legacy} so that it doesn't get
%    lost.
%
%    However, over time the remaining cases of direct usage need
%    updating because in one of the future release of \LaTeX{} we will
%    turn this legacy support off, as it does unnecessary slow down
%    the processing.
%
%
% \section{\LaTeXe{} commands and environments augmented by hooks}
%
%    In this section we describe the standard hooks that are now
%    offered by \LaTeX{}, or give pointers to other documents in which
%    they are described. This section will grow over time (and
%    perhaps eventually move to usrguide3).  
%
% \subsection{Generic hooks}
% \label{sec:generic}
%
% As stated earlier, with the exception of generic hooks, all hooks must 
% be declared with \cs{NewHook} before they can be used.  
% All generic hooks have names of the form 
% \enquote{\meta{type}/\meta{name}/\meta{position}}, where \meta{type}
% is from the predefined list shown below, and \meta{name} is the variable
% part whose meaning will depend on the \meta{type}. The last component,
% \meta{position}, has more complex possibilities: 
% it can always be |before| or |after|; for |env| hooks, it can also be |begin|
% or |end|; and for |include| hooks it can also be |end|.  Each specific
% hook is documented below, or in \texttt{ltcmdhooks-doc.pdf} or
% \texttt{ltfilehook-doc.pdf}.
%
% The generic hooks provided by \LaTeX{} belong to one of the six types:
% \begin{description}
%   \item[env] Hooks executed before and after environments --
%     \meta{name} is the name of the environment, and available values
%     for \meta{position} are |before|, |begin|, |end|, and |after|;
%   \item[cmd] Hooks added to and executed before and after commands --
%     \meta{name} is the name of the command, and available values
%     for \meta{position} are |before| and |after|;
%   \item[file] Hooks executed before and after reading a file --
%     \meta{name} is the name of the file (with extension), and
%     available values for \meta{position} are |before| and |after|;
%   \item[package] Hooks executed before and after loading packages --
%     \meta{name} is the name of the package, and available values for
%     \meta{position} are |before| and |after|;
%   \item[class] Hooks executed before and after loading classes --
%     \meta{name} is the name of the class, and available values for
%     \meta{position} are |before| and |after|;
%   \item[include] Hooks executed before and after \cs{include}d files -- 
%     \meta{name} is the name of the included file (without the |.tex|
%     extension), and available values for \meta{position} are |before|,
%     |end|, and |after|.
% \end{description}
%
% Each of the hooks above are detailed in the following sections and
% in linked documentation.
% ^^A^^A^^A \pho{Wouldn't it be better to document all hooks here?}
%
% \subsubsection{Generic hooks for all environments}
%
%    Every environment \meta{env} has now four associated hooks coming
%    with it:
%    \begin{description}
%    \item[\hook{env/\meta{env}/before}]
%
%       This hook is executed as part of \cs{begin} as the very first
%       action, in particular prior to starting the environment group.
%       Its scope is therefore not restricted by the environment.
%
%    \item[\hook{env/\meta{env}/begin}]
%
%       This hook is executed as part of \cs{begin} directly in front
%       of the code specific to the environment start (e.g., the
%       second argument of \cs{newenvironment}).  Its scope is the
%       environment body.
%
%    \item[\hook{env/\meta{env}/end}]
%
%       This hook is executed as part of \cs{end} directly in front of the
%       code specific to the end of the environment (e.g., the third
%       argument of \cs{newenvironment}).
%
%    \item[\hook{env/\meta{env}/after}]
%
%       This hook is executed as part of \cs{end} after the
%       code specific to the environment end and after the environment
%       group has ended.
%       Its scope is therefore not restricted by the environment.
%
%       The hook is implemented as a reversed hook so if two packages
%       add code to \hook{env/\meta{env}/before} and to
%       \hook{env/\meta{env}/after} they can add surrounding
%       environments and the order of closing them happens in the
%       right sequence.
%
%    \end{description}
%    Generic environment hooks are never one-time hooks even with
%    environments that are supposed to appear only once in a
%    document.\footnote{Thus if one adds code to such hooks after the
%    environment has been processed, it will only be executed if the
%    environment appears again and if that doesn't happen the code
%    will never get executed.}  In contrast to other hooks there is
%    also no need to declare them using \cs{NewHook}.
%
%    The hooks are only executed if \cs{begin}\Arg{env} and
%    \cs{end}\Arg{env} is used. If the environment code is executed
%    via low-level calls to \cs[no-index]{\meta{env}} and \cs[no-index]{end\meta{env}}
%    (e.g., to avoid the environment grouping) they are not
%    available. If you want them available in code using this method,
%    you would need to add them yourself, i.e., write something like
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \UseHook{env/quote/before}\quote
%      ...
%  \endquote\UseHook{env/quote/after}
%\end{verbatim}
%    to add the outer hooks, etc.
%
%
%    Largely for compatibility with existing packages, the following
%    four commands are also available to set the environment hooks; but for
%    new packages we recommend directly using the hook names and
%    \cs{AddToHook}.
%
%
% \begin{function}{\BeforeBeginEnvironment}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{BeforeBeginEnvironment} \oarg{label} \Arg{env} \Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   This declaration adds to the \hook{env/\meta{env}/before} hook
%    using the \meta{label}.  If \meta{label} is not given, the
%    \meta{default label} is used (see section~\ref{sec:default-label}).
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\AtBeginEnvironment}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AtBeginEnvironment} \oarg{label} \Arg{env} \Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   This is like \cs{BeforeBeginEnvironment} but it adds to the \hook{env/\meta{env}/begin} hook.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\AtEndEnvironment}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AtEndEnvironment} \oarg{label} \Arg{env} \Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   This is like \cs{BeforeBeginEnvironment} but it adds to the \hook{env/\meta{env}/end} hook.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\AfterEndEnvironment}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AfterEndEnvironment} \oarg{label} \Arg{env} \Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   This is like \cs{BeforeBeginEnvironment} but it adds to the \hook{env/\meta{env}/after} hook.
% \end{function}
%
%
% \subsubsection{Generic hooks for commands}
%
%    Similar to environments there are now (at least in theory) two
%    generic hooks available for any \LaTeX{} command. These are
%    \begin{description}
%    \item[\hook{cmd/\meta{name}/before}]
%
%       This hook is executed at the very start of the command
%       execution.
%
%    \item[\hook{cmd/\meta{name}/after}]
%       This hook is executed at the very end of the command body.  It is
%       implemented as a reversed hook.
%    \end{description}
%    In practice there are restrictions and especially the
%    \hook{after} hook works only with a subset of commands. Details
%    about these restrictions are documented in
%    \texttt{ltcmdhooks-doc.pdf} or with code in
%    \texttt{ltcmdhooks-code.pdf}.
%
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{Generic hooks provided by file loading operations}
%
%    There are several hooks added to \LaTeX{}'s process of loading
%    file via its high-level interfaces such as \cs{input},
%    \cs{include}, \cs{usepackage}, \cs{RequirePackage}, etc. These
%    are documented in \texttt{ltfilehook-doc.pdf} or with code in
%    \texttt{ltfilehook-code.pdf}.
%
%
%
% \subsection{Hooks provided by \cs{begin}\texttt{\{document\}}}
% \label{sec:begindocument-hooks}
%
%    Until 2020 \cs{begin}\texttt{\{document\}} offered exactly one
%    hook that one could add to using
%    \cs{AtBeginDocument}. Experiences over the years have shown that
%    this single hook in one place was not enough and as part of
%    adding the general hook management system a number of additional
%    hooks have been added at this point. The places for these hooks have
%    been chosen to provide the same support as offered by external
%    packages, such as \pkg{etoolbox} and others that augmented
%    \cs{document} to gain better control.
%
%    Supported are now the following hooks (all of them one-time hooks):
%    \begin{description}
%
%
%    \item[\hook{begindocument/before}]
%
%      This hook is executed at the very start of \cs{document}, one can
%      think of it as a hook for code at the end of the preamble
%      section and this is how it is used by \pkg{etoolbox}'s
%      \cs{AtEndPreamble}.
%
%      \onetimetext
%
%    \item[\hook{begindocument}]
%
%      This hook is added to when using \cs{AtBeginDocument} and it is
%      executed after the \texttt{.aux} file as be read in and most
%      initialization are done, so they can be altered and inspected by
%      the hook code. It is followed by a small number of further
%      initializations that shouldn't be altered and are therefore
%      coming later.
%
%      The hook should not be used to add material for typesetting as
%      we are still in \LaTeX's initialization phase and not in the
%      document body. If such material needs to be added to the document
%      body use the next hook instead.
%
%      \onetimetext
%
%    \item[\hook{begindocument/end}]
%
%      This hook is executed at the end of the \cs{document} code in
%      other words at the beginning of the document body. The only
%      command that follows it is \cs{ignorespaces}.
%
%      \onetimetext
%
%    \end{description}
%    The generic hooks executed by \cs{begin} also exist, i.e.,
%    \hook{env/document/before} and \hook{env/document/begin}, but
%    with this special environment it is better use the dedicated
%    one-time hooks above.
%
%
%
%
% \subsection{Hooks provided by \cs{end}\texttt{\{document\}}}
%
%    \LaTeXe{} has always provided \cs{AtEndDocument} to add code to the
%    \verb=\end{document}=, just in front of the code that
%    is normally executed there. While this was a big improvement over
%    the situation in \LaTeX\,2.09, it was not flexible enough for a
%    number of use cases and so packages, such as \pkg{etoolbox},
%    \pkg{atveryend} and others patched \cs{enddocument} to add
%    additional points where code could be hooked into.
%
%    Patching using packages is always problematical as leads to
%    conflicts (code availability, ordering of patches, incompatible
%    patches, etc.).  For this reason a number of additional hooks
%    have been added to the \cs{enddocument} code to allow packages
%    to add code in various places in a controlled way without the
%    need for overwriting or patching the core code.
%
%    Supported are now the following hooks (all of them one-time hooks):
%    \begin{description}
%
%    \item[\hook{enddocument}]
%
%      The hook associated with \cs{AtEndDocument}. It is immediately
%      called at the beginning of \cs{enddocument}.
%
%      When this hook is executed there may be still unprocessed
%      material (e.g., floats on the deferlist) and the hook may add
%      further material to be typeset. After it, \cs{clearpage} is
%      called to ensure that all such material gets typeset. If there
%      is nothing waiting the \cs{clearpage} has no effect.
%
%      \onetimetext
%
%    \item[\hook{enddocument/afterlastpage}]
%
%      As the name indicates this hook should not receive code that
%      generates material for further pages. It is the right place to
%      do some final housekeeping and possibly write out some
%      information to the \texttt{.aux} file (which is still open at
%      this point to receive data, but since there will be no more pages you
%      need to write to it using \cs{immediate}\cs{write}). It is also the
%      correct place to
%      set up any testing code to be run when the \texttt{.aux} file
%      is re-read in the next step.
%
%
%      After this hook has been executed the \texttt{.aux} file is
%      closed for writing and then read back in to do some tests
%      (e.g., looking for missing references or duplicated labels, etc.).
%
%      \onetimetext
%
%    \item[\hook{enddocument/afteraux}]
%
%      At this point, the \texttt{.aux} file has been reprocessed and so
%      this is a possible place for final checks and display of
%      information to the user. However, for the latter you might
%      prefer the next hook, so that your information is displayed after the
%      (possibly longish) list of files if that got requested via \cs{listfiles}.
%
%      \onetimetext
%
%    \item[\hook{enddocument/info}]
%
%      This hook is meant to receive code that write final information
%      messages to the terminal. It follows immediately after the
%      previous hook (so both could have been combined, but then
%      packages adding further code would always need to also supply
%      an explicit rule to specify where it should go.
%
%      This hook already contains some code added by the kernel (under
%      the labels \texttt{kernel/filelist} and
%      \texttt{kernel/warnings}), namely the list of files when
%      \cs{listfiles} has been used and the warnings for duplicate
%      labels, missing references, font substitutions etc.
%
%      \onetimetext
%
%    \item[\hook{enddocument/end}]
%
%      Finally, this hook is executed just in front of the final call
%      to \cs{@{}@end}.
%
%      \onetimetext % is it even possible to add code after this one?
%
%    \end{description}
%
%
%    There is also the hook \hook{shipout/lastpage}. This hook is
%    executed as part of the last \cs{shipout} in the document to
%    allow package to add final \cs{special}'s to that page. Where
%    this hook is executed in relation to those from the above list
%    can vary from document to document. Furthermore to determine correctly
%    which of the \cs{shipout}s is the last one, \LaTeX{} needs to be run
%    several times, so initially it might get executed on the wrong
%    page. See section~\ref{sec:shipout} for where to find the details.
%
%
%    It is in also possible to use the generic \hook{env/document/end}
%    hook which is executed by \cs{end}, i.e., just in front of the
%    first hook above. Note however that the other generic \cs{end}
%    environment hook, i.e., \hook{env/document/after} will never get
%    executed, because by that time \LaTeX{} has finished the document
%    processing.
%
%
%
%
% \subsection{Hooks provided by \cs{shipout} operations}
% \label{sec:shipout}
%
%    There are several hooks and mechanisms added to \LaTeX{}'s
%    process of generating pages. These are documented in
%    \texttt{ltshipout-doc.pdf} or with code in
%    \texttt{ltshipout-code.pdf}.
%
%
% \subsection{Hooks provided for paragraphs}
% \label{sec:para}
%
%    The paragraph processing has been augmented to include a number of
%    internal and public hooks. These are documented in
%    \texttt{ltpara-doc.pdf} or with code in
%    \texttt{ltpara-code.pdf}.
%
%
%
% \subsection{Hooks provided in NFSS commands}
%
%    In languages that need to support for more than one script in
%    parallel (and thus several sets of fonts, e.g., supporting both Latin and
%    Japanese fonts), NFSS font commands such as \cs{sffamily} need
%    to switch both the Latin family to ``Sans Serif'' and in addition
%    alter a second set of fonts.
%
%    To support this, several NFSS commands have hooks to which 
%    such support can be added.
%    \begin{description}
%
%    \item[\hook{rmfamily}]
%
%      After \cs{rmfamily} has done its initial checks and prepared a
%      font series update, this hook is executed before \cs{selectfont}.
%
%    \item[\hook{sffamily}]
%
%      This is like the \hook{rmfamily} hook, but for the \cs{sffamily} command.
%
%    \item[\hook{ttfamily}]
%
%      This is like the \hook{rmfamily} hook, but for the \cs{ttfamily} command.
%
%    \item[\hook{normalfont}]
%
%      The \cs{normalfont} command resets the font encoding, family, series
%      and shape to their document defaults. It then executes this
%      hook and finally calls \cs{selectfont}.
%
%    \item[\hook{expand@font@defaults}]
%
%      The internal \cs{expand@font@defaults} command expands and
%      saves the current defaults for the meta families (rm/sf/tt) and
%      the meta series (bf/md). If the NFSS machinery has been
%      augmented, e.g., for Chinese or Japanese fonts, then further
%      defaults may need to be set at this point. This can be done in
%      this hook which is executed at the end of this macro.
%
%    \item[\hook{bfseries/defaults}, \hook{bfseries}]
%
%      If the \cs{bfdefault} was explicitly changed by the user, its
%      new value is used to set the bf series defaults for the meta
%      families (rm/sf/tt) when \cs{bfseries} is called. The
%      \hook{bfseries/defaults} hook allows further adjustments to be made
%      in this case.  This hook is only executed if such a change is
%      detected. In contrast, the \hook{bfseries} hook is always
%      executed just before \cs{selectfont} is called to change to the
%      new series.
%
%
%    \item[\hook{mdseries/defaults}, \hook{mdseries}]
%
%       These two hooks are like the previous ones but they are in the
%      \cs{mdseries} command.
%
%    \item[\hook{selectfont}]
%
%      This hook is executed inside \cs{selectfont}, after the current
%      values for \textit{encoding}, \textit{family}, \textit{series},
%      \textit{shape}, and \textit{size} are evaluated and the new font
%      is selected (and if necessary loaded). After the hook has
%      executed, NFSS will still do any updates necessary for a new
%      \textit{size} (such as changing the size of \cs{strut}) and any
%      updates necessary to a change in \textit{encoding}.
%
%      This hook is intended for use cases where, in parallel to a
%      change in the main font, some other fonts need to be altered 
%      (e.g., in CJK processing where you may need to deal with several
%      different alphabets).

%
%    \item[\hook{insertmark}]
%
%      This hook allows for a special setup while \cs{InsertMark}
%      inserts a mark. It is executed in group so local changes only
%      apply to the mark being inserted.

% \DescribeMacro{\@@\textvisiblespace\meta{hook}}
% \DescribeMacro{\g_@@_\meta{hook}_reversed_tl}

% \DescribeMacro{\g_@@_\meta{hook}_parameter_tl}
% \DescribeMacro{\@@_next\textvisiblespace\meta{hook}}
% \DescribeMacro{\@@_toplevel\textvisiblespace\meta{hook}}
%    Hooks have a name (called \meta{hook} in the description below)
%    and for each hook we have to
%    provide a number of data structures. These are
%    \begin{description}
%    \item[\cs{g_@@_\meta{hook}_code_prop}] A property list holding the code
%    for the hook in separate chunks. The keys are by default the
%    package names that add code to the hook, but it is possible
%    for packages to define other keys.
%
%    \item[{\cs[no-index]{g_@@_\meta{hook}_rule_\meta{label1}\string|\meta{label2}_tl}}]
%    A token list holding the relation between \meta{label1} and
%    \meta{label2} in the \meta{hook}.  The \meta{labels} are lexically
%    (reverse) sorted to ensure that two labels always point to the same
%    token list.  For global rules, the \meta{hook} name is \texttt{??}.
%
%    \item[\cs{@@\textvisiblespace\meta{hook}}] The code that is actually executed
%    when the hook is called in the document is stored in this token
%    list. It is constructed from the code chunks applying the
%    information.
%    This token list is named like that so that in case of an error
%    inside the hook, the reported token list in the error is shorter,
%    and to make it simpler to normalize hook names in
%    \cs{@@_make_name:n}.
%
%    \item[\cs{g_@@_\meta{hook}_reversed_tl}] Some hooks are
%    \enquote{reversed}.  This token list stores a |-| for such hook
%    so that it can be identified.  The |-| character is used because
%    $\meta{reversed}1$ is $+1$ for normal hooks and $-1$ for reversed
%    ones.
%
%    \item[{\cs[no-index]{g_@@_\meta{hook}_declared_tl}}] This token
%    list serves as a marker for the hook being officially declared. Its
%    existence is tested to raise an error in case another declaration
%    is attempted.
%
%    \item[{\cs[no-index]{c_@@_\meta{hook}_parameter_tl}}] This token
%    list stores the parameter text for a declared hook (its existence
%    almost completely intersects the token list above), which is used
%    for managing hooks with arguments.
%
%    \item[\cs{@@_toplevel\textvisiblespace\meta{hook}}] This token list stores the code
%    inserted in the hook from the user's document, in the |top-level|
%    label.  This label is special, and doesn't participate in sorting.
%    Instead, all code is appended to it and executed after (or before,
%    if the hook is reversed) the normal
%    hook code, but before the |next| code chunk.
%
%    \item[\cs{@@_next\textvisiblespace\meta{hook}}] Finally there is
%    extra code (normally empty) that is used on the next invocation
%    of the hook (and then deleted). This can be used to define some
%    special behavior for a single occasion from within the document.
%    This token list follows the same naming scheme than the main
%    \cs{@@\textvisiblespace\meta{hook}} token list.  It is called
%    \cs{@@_next\textvisiblespace\meta{hook}} rather than
%    \cs[no-index]{@@\textvisiblespace next_\meta{hook}} because
%    otherwise a hook whose name is |next_|\meta{hook} would clash
%    with the next code-token list of the hook called \meta{hook}.
%
%    \end{description}
%
%
% \subsubsection{On the existence of hooks}
% \label{sec:existence}
%
%    A hook may be in different states of existence. Here we give an
%    overview of the internal commands to set up hooks and explain how the
%    different states are distinguished. The actual implementation
%    then follows in subsequent sections.
%
%    One problem we have to solve is that we need to be able to add
%    code to hooks (e.g., with \cs{AddToHook}) even if that code has
%    not yet been declared. For example, one package needs to write
%    into a hook of another package, but that package may not get
%    loaded, or is loaded only later. Another problem is that most hooks, 
%    but not the generic hooks, require a declaration.
%
%    We therefore distinguish the following states for a hook, which
%    are managed by four different tests: structure existence
%    (\cs{@@_if_structure_exist:nTF}), creation
%    (\cs{@@_if_usable:nTF}), declaration (\cs{@@_if_declared:nTF})
%    and disabled or not (\cs{@@_if_disabled:nTF})
%    \begin{description}
%    \setlist[itemize]{leftmargin=5cm,format=\cs}
%    \item[not existing]
%
%       Nothing is known about the hook so far. This state can be
%       detected with \cs{@@_if_structure_exist:nTF}
%       (which uses the  false branch).
%
%       In this state the hook can be declared, disabled, rules can be
%       defined or code could be added to it, but it is not possible
%       to use the hook (with \cs{UseHook}).

%    \item[basic data structure set up]
%
%       A hook is this state when its basic data structure has been
%       set up (using \cs{@@_init_structure:n}). The data structure setup happens
%       automatically when commands such as \cs{AddToHook}  are used
%       and the hook is at that point in state \enquote{not existing}.
%
%       In this state the four tests give the following results:
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item [@@_if_structure_exist:nTF]      returns |true|.
%       \item [@@_if_usable:nTF]   returns |false|.
%       \item [@@_if_declared:nTF]  returns |false|.
%       \item [@@_if_disabled:nTF]  returns |false|.
%     \end{itemize}
%
%       The allowed actions are the same as in the \enquote{not
%       existing} state.
%
%    \item[declared]
%
%       A hook is in this state it is not disabled and was explicitly declared (e.g.,
%       with \cs{NewHook}). In this case the four tests give the
%       following results:
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item [@@_if_structure_exist:nTF]      returns |true|.
%       \item [@@_if_usable:nTF]   returns |true|.
%       \item [@@_if_declared:nTF]  returns |true|.
%       \item [@@_if_disabled:nTF]  returns |false|.
%     \end{itemize}
%
%    \item[usable]
%
%       A hook is in this state if it is not disabled, was not
%       explicitly declared but nevertheless is allowed to be used
%       (with \cs{UseHook} or \cs{hook_use:n}). This state is only
%       possible for generic hooks as they do not need to be
%       declared. Therefore such hooks move directly from state
%       \enquote{not existing} to \enquote{usable} the moment a
%       declaration such as \cs{AddToHook} wants to add to the hook
%       data structure.  In this state the tests give the following
%       results:
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item [@@_if_structure_exist:nTF]      returns |true|.
%       \item [@@_if_usable:nTF]   returns |true|.
%       \item [@@_if_declared:nTF]  returns |false|.
%       \item [@@_if_disabled:nTF]  returns |false|.
%     \end{itemize}
%
%
%    \item[disabled]
%
%       A generic hook in any state is moved to this state when
%       \cs{DisableGenericHook} is used. This changes the tests to give the
%       following results:
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item [@@_if_structure_exist:nTF]      \emph{unchanged}.
%       \item [@@_if_usable:nTF]   returns |false|.
%       \item [@@_if_declared:nTF]  returns |true|.
%       \item [@@_if_disabled:nTF]  returns |true|.
%     \end{itemize}
%       The  structure test is unchanged (if the hook was unknown before it is
%       |false|, otherwise |true|). The usable test returns |false| so that
%       any \cs{UseHook} will bypass the hook from now on. The
%       declared test returns true so that any further \cs{NewHook}
%       generates an error and the disabled test returns true so that
%       \cs{AddToHook} can return an error.

%    \cs[no-index]{@@_toplevel\textvisiblespace\meta{hook}} and

%    \cs{@@_normalise_cs_args:nn} does the normalisation by using the

%    Now ensure that the base data structure for the hook exists:

%    \end{macrocode}
%    The call to \cs{@@_normalise_code_pool:n} will correct any improper
%    reference to arguments that don't exist in the hook, raising a
%    low-level \TeX{} error and doubling the offending parameter tokens.
%    It has to be done after \cs{@@_init_structure:n} because it
%    operates on \cs[no-index]{g_@@_\meta{hook}_code_prop}.
%    \begin{macrocode}
        \@@_normalise_code_pool:n {#1}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    The \cs{g_@@_\meta{hook}_labels_clist} holds the sorted list of
%    labels (once it got sorted). This is used only for debugging.
%    These are defined conditionally, in case \cs{@@_make_usable:nn}

% \begin{macro}{\@@_curr_name_pop:}
% \begin{macro}{\@@_end_document_label_check:}
%   The token list \cs{g_@@_hook_curr_name_tl} stores the name of the
%   current package/file to be used as the default label in hooks.
%   Providing a consistent interface is tricky because packages can
%   be loaded within packages, and some packages may not use
%   \cs{SetDefaultHookLabel} to change the default label (in which
%   case \cs{@currname} is used).
%
%   To pull that one off, we keep a stack that contains the default
%   label for each level of input.  The bottom of the stack contains the
%   default label for the |top-level| (this stack should never go
%   empty). If we're building the format, set the default label to be
%   |top-level|:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\tl_gset:Nn \g_@@_hook_curr_name_tl { top-level }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%   Then, in case we're in \pkg{latexrelease} we push something on
%   the stack to support roll forward.  But in some rare cases,
%   \pkg{latexrelease} may be loaded inside another package (notably
%   \pkg{platexrelease}), so we'll first push the |top-level| entry:
%   \changes{v1.0i}{2021/03/18}
%           {Only add \texttt{top-level} if not already there.}
%    \begin{macrocode}

%<latexrelease>  { \seq_gput_right:Nn \g_@@_name_stack_seq { top-level } }
%    \end{macrocode}
%   then we dissect the \cs{@currnamestack}, adding \cs{@currname} to
%   the stack:
% \changes{v1.0f}{2020/11/24}{Support for roll forward (gh/434)}
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<latexrelease>\cs_set_protected:Npn \@@_tmp:w #1 #2 #3

%<latexrelease>  \q_recursion_tail \q_recursion_tail
%<latexrelease>  \q_recursion_tail \q_recursion_stop
%    \end{macrocode}
%   and finally set the default label to be the \cs{@currname}:
%   \changes{v1.0i}{2021/03/18}
%           {Remove the (empty) \enquote{top-level} from \cs{@currnamestack}.}

%<latexrelease>\seq_gpop_right:NN \g_@@_name_stack_seq \l_@@_tmpa_tl
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%   Two commands keep track of the stack: when a file is input,
%   \cs{@@_curr_name_push:n} pushes the current default label onto the
%   stack and sets the new default label (all in one go):
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_curr_name_push:n #1
  { \exp_args:Nx \@@_curr_name_push_aux:n { \@@_make_name:n {#1} } }

          }
      }
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
%   and when an input is over, the topmost item of the stack is popped,
%   since that label will not be used again, and \cs{g_@@_hook_curr_name_tl}
%   is updated to equal the now topmost item of the stack:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_curr_name_pop:

      { \msg_error:nn { hooks } { extra-pop-label } }
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%   At the end of the document we want to check if there was no
%   \cs{@@_curr_name_push:n} without a matching \cs{@@_curr_name_pop:}
%   (not a critical error, but it might indicate that something else is

% \begin{macro}{\@@_set_normalise_fn:nn}
%   This one's a bit of a hack.  It takes a hook, and iterates over its
%   code pool (\cs[no-index]{g_@@_\meta{hook}_code_prop}), redefining
%   each code label to use only valid arguments.  This is used when, for
%   example, a code is added referencing arguments \verb|#1| and
%   \verb|#2|, but the hook has only \verb|#1|.  In this example, every
%   reference to \verb|#2| is changed to \verb|##2|.  This is done
%   because otherwise \TeX{} will throw a low-level error every time
%   some change happens to the hook (code is added, a rule is set, etc),
%   which can get quite repetitive for no good reason.

%   First, call \cs{@@_set_normalise_fn:nn} with the hook name to set
%   everything up, then we'll loop over the

%   done, copy the temporary property list back to the hook's.

  }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%   The sole purpose of this function is to define
%   \cs{@@_normalise_fn:nn}, which will then do the correcting of the
%   code being added to the hook.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_set_normalise_fn:nn #1 #2
  {
%    \end{macrocode}
%   To start, we define two auxiliary token lists.
%   \cs[no-index]{l_@@_tmpb_tl} contains:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   {\c__hook_hashes_tl 1}
%   {\c__hook_hashes_tl 2}

    \tl_set:Nn \exp_not:N \l_@@_tmpb_tl { \l_@@_tmpb_tl }
        }
%    \end{macrocode}
%   And \cs[no-index]{l_@@_tmpa_tl} contains:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   {\c__hook_hash_tl 1}
%   {\c__hook_hash_tl 2}
%   ...
%   {\c__hook_hash_tl <n>}
%\end{verbatim}
%   with \meta{n} being the number of arguments declared for the hook.

    \tl_set:Ne \l_@@_tmpa_tl { \@@_braced_cs_parameter:n { @@_tmp:w } }
%    \end{macrocode}
%   Now this function does the fun part.  It is meant to be used with
%   \cs{prop_map_function:NN}, taking a label name in \verb|##1| and the
%   code stored in that label in \verb|##2|.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \cs_gset_protected:Npx \@@_normalise_fn:nn ##1 ##2
      {
%    \end{macrocode}
%   Here we'll define two auxiliary macros:  the first one throws an
%   error when it detects an invalid argument reference.  It piggybacks
%   on \TeX's low-level \enquote{Illegal parameter number} error, but it
%   defines a weirdly-named control sequence so that the error comes out
%   nicely formatted.  For example, if the label \enquote{badpkg} adds
%   some code that references argument \verb|#3| in the hook
%   \enquote{foo}, which takes only two arguments, the error will be:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   ! Illegal parameter number in definition of hook 'foo'.
%   (hooks)             Offending label: 'badpkg'.
%   <to be read again> 
%                      3
%\end{verbatim}
%   At the point of this definition, the error is raised if the code
%   happens to reference an invalid argument.  If it was possible to
%   detect that this definition raised no error, the next step would be
%   unnecessary.  We'll do all this in a group so this weird definition
%   doesn't leak out, and set \cs{tex_escapechar:D} to $-1$ so this hack
%   shows up extra nice in the case of an error.
%    \begin{macrocode}
        \group_begin:

%
%    Initially these variables simply used an empty ``label'' name (not
%    two question marks). This was a bit unfortunate, because then
%    \texttt{l3doc} complains about \verb=__= in the middle of a
%    command name when trying to typeset the documentation. However
%    using a ``normal'' name such as \texttt{default} has the
%    disadvantage of that being not really distinguishable from a real
%    hook name. I now have settled for \texttt{??} which needs some
%    gymnastics to get it into the csname, but since this is used a
%    lot, the code should be fast, so this is not done with \texttt{c}
%    expansion in the code later on.
%
%    \cs{@@\textvisiblespace??} isn't used, but it has to be defined to
%    trick the code into thinking that \texttt{??} is actually a hook.

%
%    Default rules are always given in normal ordering (never in
%    reversed ordering). If such a rule is applied to a reversed
%    hook it behaves as if the rule is reversed (e.g.,
%    \texttt{after} becomes \texttt{before})
%    because those rules are applied first and then the order is reversed.

%
%    For the sorting I am basically implementing Knuth's algorithm for
%    topological sorting as given in TAOCP volume 1 pages 263--266.
%    For this algorithm we need a number of local variables:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item
%       List of labels used in the current hook to label code chunks:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\seq_new:N \l_@@_labels_seq
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \item
%      Number of labels used in the current hook. In Knuth's algorithm
%      this is called $N$:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\int_new:N \l_@@_labels_int
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \item
%      The sorted code list to be build is managed using two pointers
%      one to the front of the queue and one to the rear. We model this
%      using token list pointers. Knuth calls them $F$ and $R$:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\tl_new:N \l_@@_front_tl
\tl_new:N \l_@@_rear_tl
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \item
%      The data for the start of the queue is kept in this token list,
%      it corresponds to what Don calls \texttt{QLINK[0]} but since we
%      aren't manipulating individual words in memory it is slightly
%      differently done:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\tl_new:c { \@@_tl_csname:n { 0 } }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    \end{itemize}
%  \end{macro}
%
%
%  \begin{macro}{\@@_initialize_single:NNn,\@@_initialize_single:ccn}
%
%    \cs{@@_initialize_single:NNn} implements the sorting of the code
%    chunks for a hook and saves the result in the token list for fast
%    execution (\verb=#4=). The arguments are \meta{hook-code-plist},
%    \meta{hook-code-tl}, \meta{hook-top-level-code-tl},
%    \meta{hook-next-code-tl},
%    \meta{hook-ordered-labels-clist} and \meta{hook-name} (the latter
%    is only used for debugging---the \meta{hook-rule-plist} is accessed
%    using the \meta{hook-name}).
%
%    The additional complexity compared to Don's algorithm is that we
%    do not use simple positive integers but have arbitrary
%    alphanumeric labels. As usual Don's data structures are chosen in
%    a way that one can omit a lot of tests and I have mimicked that as
%    far as possible. The result is a restriction I do not test for at
%    the moment: a label can't be equal to the number 0!

%
%    We loop over the property list holding the code and record all
%    the labels listed there. Only the rules for those labels are of interest
%    to us. While we are at it we count them (which gives us the $N$
%    in Knuth's algorithm).  The prefix |label_| is added to the variables
%    to ensure that labels named |front|, |rear|, |labels|, or |return|
%    don't interact with our code.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \prop_map_inline:Nn \l_@@_work_prop

%    Steps T2 and T3: Here we sort the relevant rules into the data structure\ldots
%
%    This loop constitutes a square matrix of the labels in
%    \cs{l_@@_work_prop} in the
%    vertical and the horizontal directions.  However, since the rule
%    $l_A\meta{rel}l_B$ is the same as $l_B\meta{rel}^{-1}l_A$ we can cut
%    the loop short at the diagonal of the matrix (\emph{i.e.}, when
%    both labels are equal), saving a good amount of time.  The way the
%    rules were set up (see the implementation of \cs{@@_rule_before_gset:nnn}
%    above) ensures that we have no rule in the ignored side of the
%    matrix, and all rules are seen.  The rules are applied in
%    \cs{@@_apply_label_pair:nnn}, which takes the properly-ordered pair
%    of labels as argument.

%    \end{macrocode}
%    Now take a breath, and look at the data structures that have

    \@@_debug:n { \@@_debug_label_data:N \l_@@_work_prop }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%
%    Step T4:

    \@@_tl_gclear:N #1

%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    The whole loop gets combined in steps T5--T7:

    \bool_while_do:nn { ! \str_if_eq_p:Vn \l_@@_front_tl { 0 } }
      {
%    \end{macrocode}
%    This part is step T5:

%
%    This is step T6, except that we don't use a pointer $P$ to move

%    \begin{macrocode}

          }
%    \end{macrocode}

%
%    This is step T8: If we haven't moved the code for all labels
%    (i.e., if \cs{l_@@_labels_int} is still greater than zero) we
%    have a loop and our partial order can't be flattened out.

%    After we have added all hook code to \verb=#1=, we finish it off

%    change for a reversed hook (then |top-level| is the very first code
%    chunk added).  The |next| code is always added last (to the right).
%   The hook may take arguments, so we add a run of braced parameters
%   after the \verb|_next| and \verb|_toplevel| macros, so that the
%   arguments passed to the hook are forwarded to them.

%    If we see \texttt{\detokenize{->}} we have to drop code for label
%    \verb=#3= and carry on. We could do a little better and drop
%    everything for that label since it doesn't matter where we put

%    lot with little gain.\footnote{This also has the advantage that
%    the result of the sorting doesn't change, as it might otherwise do
%    (for unrelated chunks) if we aren't careful.} So we still
%    unnecessarily try to sort it in and depending on the rules that
%    might result in a loop that is otherwise resolved. If that turns
%    out to be a real issue, we can improve the code.
%
%    Here the code is removed from \cs{l_@@_cur_hook_tl} rather than
%    \verb=#3= because the latter may be \texttt{??}, and the default
%    hook doesn't store any code.  Removing it instead from \cs{l_@@_cur_hook_tl}
%    makes the default rules \verb=->= and  \verb=<-= work properly.

% \subsection{Using the hook}
%
% \begin{macro}{\hook_use:n}
% \begin{macro}[EXP]{\@@_use_initialized:n}
% \begin{macro}{\@@_preamble_hook:n}
%   \cs{hook_use:n} as defined here is used in the preamble, where
%   hooks aren't initialized by default.  \cs{@@_use_initialized:n} is
%   also defined, which is the non-\tn{protected} version for use within
%   the document.  Their definition is identical, except for the
%   \cs{@@_preamble_hook:n} (which wouldn't hurt in the expandable
%   version, but it would be an unnecessary extra expansion).
%
%   \cs{@@_use_initialized:n} holds the expandable definition while in
%   the preamble. \cs{@@_preamble_hook:n} initializes the hook in the
%   preamble, and is redefined to \cs{use_none:n} at |\begin{document}|.
%
%   Both versions do the same thing internally: they check that the hook exists as
%   given, and if so they use it as quickly as possible.
%
%   At |\begin{document}|, all hooks are initialized, and any change in
%   them causes an update, so \cs{hook_use:n} can be made expandable.
%   This one is better not protected so that it can expand into nothing
%   if containing no code. Also important in case of generic hooks that
%   we do not generate a \cs[no-index]{relax} as a side effect of
%   checking for a csname. In contrast to the \TeX{} low-level
%   \verb=\csname ...\endcsname= construct \cs{tl_if_exist:c} is
%   careful to avoid this.

%   \cs{@@_use:wn} does a quick check to test if the current hook is a
%   file hook: those need a special treatment.  If it is not, the hook
%   does not exist.  If it is, then \cs{@@_try_file_hook:n} is called,
%   and checks that the current hook is a file-specific hook using
%   \cs{@@_if_file_hook:wTF}.  If it's not, then it's a generic |file/|
%   hook and is used if it exist.
%
%   If it is a file-specific hook, it passes through the same
%   normalization as during declaration, and then it is used if defined.
%   \cs{@@_if_usable_use:n} checks if the hook exist, and calls

% \subsection{Querying a hook}
%
% Simpler data types, like token lists, have three possible states; they
% can exist and be empty, exist and be non-empty, and they may not
% exist, in which case emptiness doesn't apply (though
% \cs{tl_if_empty:N} returns false in this case).
%
% Hooks are a bit more complicated: they have several other states as
%    discussed in \ref{sec:existence}.
% A hook may exist or not, and either way it may or may not be empty
% (even a hook that doesn't exist may be non-empty) or may be disabled.
%
% A hook is said to be empty when no code was added to it, either to
% its permanent code pool, or to its ``next'' token list.  The hook
% doesn't need to be declared to have code added to its code pool
% (it may happen that a package $A$ defines a hook \hook{foo}, but
% it's loaded after package $B$, which adds some code to that hook.
% In this case it is important that the code added by package $B$ is
% remembered until package $A$ is loaded).
%
%    All other states can only be queried with internal tests as the
%    different states are irrelevant for package code.
%

%   Now define a wrapper that replaces the top of the stack with the

%    \begin{macrocode}
\NewDocumentCommand \SetDefaultHookLabel { m }
  { \@@_set_default_hook_label:n {#1} }
%
%   The label is only automatically updated with \cs{@onefilewithoptions}
%   (\cs{usepackage} and \cs{documentclass}), but some packages, like
%   Ti\emph{k}Z, define package-like interfaces, like
%   \cs{usetikzlibrary} that are wrappers around \cs{input}, so they
%   inherit the default label currently in force (usually |top-level|,
%   but it may change if loaded in another package).  To provide a
%   package-like behavior also for hooks in these files, we provide
%   high-level access to the default label stack.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\NewDocumentCommand \PushDefaultHookLabel { m }
  { \@@_curr_name_push:n {#1} }
\NewDocumentCommand \PopDefaultHookLabel { }
  { \@@_curr_name_pop: }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%   The current label stack holds the labels for all files but the
%   current one (more or less like \cs{@currnamestack}), and the current
%   label token list, \cs{g_@@_hook_curr_name_tl}, holds the label for
%   the current file.  However \cs{@pushfilename} happens before
%   \cs{@currname} is set, so we need to look ahead to get the
%   \cs{@currname} for the label.  \pkg{expl3} also requires the current
%   file in \cs{@pushfilename}, so here we abuse
%   \cs{@expl@push@filename@aux@@@@} to do \cs{@@_curr_name_push:n}.

% \subsection{Internal commands needed elsewhere}
%
% Here we set up a few horrible (but consistent) \LaTeXe{} names to
% allow for internal commands to be used outside this module. We
% have to unset the \texttt{@\/@} since we want double ``at'' sign
% in place of double underscores.

%    Rolling back here doesn't undefine the interface commands as they

%    the code usage.
