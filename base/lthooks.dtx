% \section{Introduction}
%
%    Hooks are points in the code of commands or environments where it
%    is possible to add processing code into existing commands. This
%    can be done by different packages that do not know about each
%    other and to allow for hopefully safe processing it is necessary
%    to sort different chunks of code added by different packages into
%    a suitable processing order.
%
%    This is done by the packages adding chunks of code (via
%    \cs{AddToHook}) and labeling their code with some label by
%    default using the package name as a label.
%
%    At \verb=\begin{document}= all code for a hook is then sorted
%    according to some rules (given by \cs{DeclareHookRule}) for fast
%    execution without processing overhead. If the hook code is
%    modified afterwards (or the rules are changed),
%    a new version for fast processing is generated.
%
%    Some hooks are used already in the preamble of the document. If
%    that happens then the hook is prepared for execution (and sorted)
%    already at that point.
%
%
% \section{Package writer interface}
%
%    The hook management system is offered as a set of CamelCase
%    commands for traditional \LaTeXe{} packages (and for use in the
%    document preamble if needed) as well as \texttt{expl3} commands
%    for modern packages, that use the L3 programming layer of
%    \LaTeX{}. Behind the scenes, a single set of data structures is
%    accessed so that packages from both worlds can coexist and access
%    hooks in other packages.
%
%
%
% \subsection{\LaTeXe\ interfaces}
%
% \subsubsection{Declaring hooks and using them in code}
%
%    With two exceptions, hooks have to be declared before they can be
%    used. The exceptions are hooks in environments (i.e., executed at
%    \cs{begin} and \cs{end}) and hooks run when loading files,
%    e.g. before and after a package is loaded, etc. Their hook names
%    depend on the environment or the file name and so declaring them
%    beforehand is difficult.
%
%
% \begin{function}{\NewHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{NewHook} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Creates a new \meta{hook}.
%    If this is a hook provided as part of a package it is suggested
%    that the \meta{hook} name is always structured as follows:
%    \meta{package-name}\texttt{/}\meta{hook-name}. If necessary you
%    can further subdivide the name by adding more \texttt{/} parts.
%    If a hook name is already taken, an error is raised and the hook
%    is not created.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\NewReversedHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{NewReversedHook} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%     Like \cs{NewHook} declares a new \meta{hook}.
%     the difference is that the code chunks for this hook are in
%     reverse order by default (those added last are executed first).
%     Any rules for the hook are applied after the default ordering.
%     See sections~\ref{sec:order} and \ref{sec:reversed-order}
%    for further details.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
%
% \begin{function}{\NewMirroredHookPair}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{NewMirroredHookPair} \Arg{hook-1} \Arg{hook-2}
%   \end{syntax}
%     A shorthand for
%    \cs{NewHook}\Arg{hook-1}\cs{NewReversedHook}\Arg{hook-2}.
%
%    The \meta{hooks} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%



% \begin{function}{\UseHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{UseHook} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Execute the hook code inside a command or environment.\footnote{For
%     legacy hooks such as \hook{begindocument} it is also
%    possible to call \cs{@...hook}, e.g., \cs{@begindocumenthook},
%    but this syntax is discouraged.}
%
%    Before \verb=\begin{document}= the fast execution code for a hook
%    is not set up, so in order to use a hook there it is explicitly
%    initialized first. As that involves assignments using a hook at
%    those times is not 100\% the same as using it after
%    \verb=\begin{document}=.
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\UseOneTimeHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{UseOneTimeHook} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Some hooks are only used (and can be only used) in one place, for
%    example, those in \verb=\begin{document}= or
%    \verb=\end{document}=. Once we have passed that point adding to
%    the hook through a defined \cs{\meta{addto-cmd}} command (e.g.,
%    \cs{AddToHook} or \cs{AtBeginDocument}, etc.\@) would have no
%    effect (as would the use of such a command inside the hook code
%    itself). It is therefore customary to redefine
%    \cs{\meta{addto-cmd}} to simply  process its argument, i.e.,
%    essentially make it behave like \cs{@firstofone}.
%
%    \cs{UseOneTimeHook} does that: it records that the hook has been
%    consumed and any further attempt to add to it will result in
%    executing the code to be added immediately.
%
%    \fmi{Maybe add an error version as well?}
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.
% \end{function}
%
%
% \subsubsection{Updating code for hooks}
%
% \begin{function}{\AddToHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AddToHook} \Arg{hook}\oarg{label}\Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Adds \meta{code} to the \meta{hook} labeled by \meta{label}. If
%    the optional argument \meta{label} is not provided, if \cs{AddToHook}
%    is used in a package/class, then the current
%    package/class name is used, otherwise \hook{top-level} is
%    used~(see section~\ref{sec:default-label}).
%
%    If there already exists code under the \meta{label} then the new
%    \meta{code} is appended to the existing one (even if this is a reversed hook).
%    If you want to replace existing code under the
%    \meta{label}, first apply \cs{RemoveFromHook}.
%
%    The hook doesn't have to exist for code to be added to
%    it. However, if it is not declared later then obviously the
%    added \meta{code} will never be executed.  This
%    allows for hooks to work regardless of package loading order and
%    enables packages to add to hook of other packages without
%    worrying whether they are actually used in the current document.
%    See section~\ref{sec:querying}.
%
%    The \meta{hook} and \meta{label} can be specified using the
%    dot-syntax to denote the current package name.
%    See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\RemoveFromHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{RemoveFromHook} \Arg{hook}\oarg{label}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Removes any code labeled by \meta{label} from the \meta{hook}.
%    If the optional
%    argument \meta{label} is not provided, if \cs{AddToHook}
%    is used in a package/class, then the current
%    package/class name is used, otherwise \hook{top-level} is used.
%
%    If the optional argument is \texttt{*}, then all code chunks are
%    removed. This is rather dangerous as it drops code from other
%    packages one may not know about!
%
%    The \meta{hook} and \meta{label} can be specified using the
%    dot-syntax to denote the current package name.
%    See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \medskip
%
% A useful application for this declaration inside the document body
% is when one wants to temporarily add code to hooks and later remove
% it again, e.g.,
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \AddToHook{env/quote/before}{\small}
%   \begin{quote}
%     A quote set in a smaller typeface
%   \end{quote}
%   ...
%   \RemoveFromHook{env/quote/before}
%   ... now back to normal for further quotes
%\end{verbatim}
% Note that you can't cancel the setting with
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \AddToHook{env/quote/before}{}
%\end{verbatim}
% because that only \enquote{adds} a further empty chunk of code to
% the hook. Adding \cs{normalsize} would work but that means the hook
% then contained \cs{small}\cs{normalsize} which means to font size
% changes for no good reason.
%
% The above is only needed if one wants to typeset several quotes in a
% smaller typeface. If the hook is only needed once then
% \cs{AddToHookNext} is simpler, because it resets itself after one use.
%
%
% \begin{function}{\AddToHookNext}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AddToHookNext} \Arg{hook}\Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Adds \meta{code} to the next invocation of the \meta{hook}.
%    The code is executed after the normal hook code has finished and
%    it is executed only once, i.e. it is deleted after it was used.
%
%    Using the declaration is a global operation, i.e., the code is
%    not lost, even if the declaration is used inside a group and the
%    next invocation happens after the group. If the declaration is
%    used several times before the hook is executed then all code is
%    executed in the order in which it was declared.\footnotemark
%
%    The hook doesn't have to exist for code to be added to it.  This
%    allows for hooks to work regardless of package loading order.
%    See section~\ref{sec:querying}.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name.  See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}\footnotetext{There is
%    no mechanism to reorder such code chunks (or delete them).}
%
% \subsection{Hook names and default labels}
% \label{sec:default-label}
%
% It is best practice to use \cs{AddToHook} in packages or classes
% \emph{without specifying a \meta{label}} because then the package
% or class name is automatically used, which is helpful if rules are
% needed, and avoids mistyping the \meta{label}.
%
% Using an explicit \meta{label} is only necessary in very specific
% situations, e.g., if you want to add several chunks of code into a
% single hook and have them placed in different parts of the hook
% (by providing some rules).
%
% The other case is when you develop a larger package with several
% sub-packages. In that case you may want to use the same
% \meta{label} throughout the sub-packages in order to avoid
% that the labels change if you internally reorganize your code.
%
% It is not enforced, but highly recommended that the hooks defined by
% a package, and the \meta{labels} used to add code to other hooks
% contain the package name to easily identify the source of the code
% chunk and to prevent clashes.  This should be the standard practice,
% so this hook management code provides a shortcut to refer to the
% current package in the name of a \meta{hook} and in a \meta{label}.
% If \meta{hook} name or \meta{label} consist just of a single dot
% (|.|), or starts with a dot followed by a slash (|./|) then the dot
% denotes the \meta{default label} (usually the current package or class
% name---see~\cs{DeclareDefaultHookLabel}).
% A \enquote{|.|} or \enquote{|./|} anywhere else in a \meta{hook} or in
% \meta{label} is treated literally and is not replaced.

% For example,
% inside the package \texttt{mypackage.sty}, the default label is
% \texttt{mypackage}, so the instructions:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \NewHook   {./hook}
%   \AddToHook {./hook}[.]{code}     % Same as \AddToHook{./hook}{code}
%   \AddToHook {./hook}[./sub]{code}
%   \DeclareHookRule{begindocument}{.}{<}{babel}
%   \AddToHook {file/after/foo.tex}{code}
% \end{verbatim}
%    are equivalent to:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \NewHook   {mypackage/hook}[mypackage]{code}
%   \AddToHook {mypackage/hook}[mypackage]{code}
%   \AddToHook {mypackage/hook}[mypackage/sub]{code}
%   \DeclareHookRule{begindocument}{mypackage}{<}{babel}
%   \AddToHook {file/after/foo.tex}{code}                  % unchanged
% \end{verbatim}
%
% The \meta{default label} is automatically set to the name of the
% current package or class (using \cs{@currname}).  If \cs{@currname}
% is not set (because the hook command is used outside of a package, or
% the current file wasn't loaded with \cs{usepackage} or
% \cs{documentclass}), then the \texttt{top-level} is used as the
% \meta{default label}.
%
% This syntax is available in all \meta{label} arguments and most
% \meta{hook}, both in the \LaTeXe{} interface, and the \LaTeX3
% interface described in section~\ref{sec:l3hook-interface}.
%
% Note, however, that the replacement of |.| by the \meta{default label}
% takes place when the hook command is executed, so actions that are
% somehow executed after the package ends will have the wrong
% \meta{default label} if the dot-syntax is used.  For that reason,
% this syntax is not available in \cs{UseHook} (and \cs{hook_use:n})
% because the hook is most of the time used outside of the package file
% in which it was defined. This syntax is also not available in the hook
% conditionals \cs{IfHookEmptyTF} (and \cs{hook_if_empty:nTF}) and
% \cs{IfHookExistTF} (and \cs{hook_if_exist:nTF}) because these
% conditionals are used in some performance-critical parts of the hook
% management code, and because they are usually used to refer to other
% package's hooks, so the dot-syntax doesn't make much sense.
%
% In some cases, for example in large packages, one may want to separate
% it in logical parts, but still use the main package name as
% \meta{label}, then the \meta{default label} can be set using
% \cs{DeclareDefaultHookLabel}:
%
% \begin{function}{\DeclareDefaultHookLabel}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{DeclareDefaultHookLabel} \Arg{default label}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Sets the \meta{default label} to be used in \meta{label} arguments.
%   If \cs{DeclareDefaultHookLabel} is not used in the
%   current package, \cs{@currname} is used instead.  If \cs{@currname}
%   is not set, the code is assumed to be in the main document, in which
%   case \texttt{top-level} is used.
%
%   The effect of \cs{DeclareDefaultHookLabel} holds for the current
%   file, and is reset to the previous value when the file is closed.
% \end{function}
%
%
% \subsubsection{Defining relations between hook code}
%
% The default assumption is that code added to hooks by different
% packages is indepedent and the order in which it is executed is
% irrelevant. While this is true in many case it is  obviously false
% in many others.
%
% Before the hook management system was introduced
% packages had to take elaborate precaution to determine of some other
% package got loaded as well (before or after) and find some ways to
% alter its behavior accordingly. In addition is was often the user's
% responsibility to load packages in the right order so that code
% added to hooks got added in the right orde and some cases even
% altering the loading order wouldn't resolve the conflicts.
%
% With the new hook management system it is now possible to define
% rules (i.e., relationships) between code chunks added by different
% packages and explicitly describe in which order they should be
% processed.
%
% \begin{function}{\DeclareHookRule}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{DeclareHookRule} \Arg{hook}\Arg{label1}\Arg{relation}\Arg{label2}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Defines a relation between \meta{label1} and \meta{label2} for a
%    given \meta{hook}. If \meta{hook} is \texttt{??} this defines a
%    relation for all hooks that use the two labels, i.e., that have
%    chunks of code labeled with \meta{label1} and \meta{label2}.
%    Rules specific to a given hook take precedence over default
%    rules that use \texttt{??} as the \meta{hook}.
%
%    Currently, the supported relations are the following:
%    \begin{itemize}
%
%    \item[\texttt{before} or \texttt{\string<}]
%
%      Code for \meta{label1} comes before code for \meta{label2}.
%
%    \item[\texttt{after} or \texttt{\string>}]
%      Code for \meta{label1} comes after code for \meta{label2}.
%
%    \item[\texttt{incompatible-warning}]
%
%      Only code for either \meta{label1} or \meta{label2} can appear
%      for that hook (a way to say that two packages---or parts of
%      them---are incompatible). A warning is raised if both labels
%      appear in the same hook.
%
%    \item[\texttt{incompatible-error}]
%
%      Like \texttt{incompatible-error} but instead of a warning a
%      \LaTeX{} error is raised, and the code for both labels are
%      dropped from that hook until the conflict is resolved.
%
%    \item[\texttt{removes}]
%
%      Code for \meta{label1} overwrites code for \meta{label2}. More
%      precisely, code for \meta{label2} is dropped for that
%      hook. This can be used, for example if one package is a
%      superset in functionality of another one and therefore wants to
%      undo code in some hook and replace it with its own version.
%
%    \item[\texttt{unrelated}]
%
%       The order of code for \meta{label1} and \meta{label2} is
%      irrelevant. This rule is there to undo an incorrect rule
%      specified earlier.
%
%    \end{itemize}
%
%    The \meta{hook} and \meta{label} can be specified using the
%    dot-syntax to denote the current package name.
%    See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
%
% \begin{function}{\ClearHookRule}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{ClearHookRule}\Arg{hook}\Arg{label1}\Arg{label2}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Syntactic sugar for saying that \meta{label1} and \meta{label2}
%    are unrelated for the given \meta{hook}.
% \end{function}
%
%
%
% \begin{function}{\DeclareDefaultHookRule}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{DeclareDefaultHookRule}\Arg{label1}\Arg{relation}\Arg{label2}
%   \end{syntax}
%   This sets up a relation between \meta{label1} and \meta{label2}
%    for all hooks unless overwritten by a specific rule for a hook.
%    Useful for cases where one package has a specific relation to
%    some other package, e.g., is \texttt{incompatible} or always
%    needs a special ordering \texttt{before} or \texttt{after}.
%    (Technically it is just a shorthand for using \cs{DeclareHookRule}
%    with \texttt{??} as the hook name.)
%
%    Declaring default rules is only supported in the document
%    premable.\footnote{Trying to do so, e.g., via
%    \cs{DeclareHookRule} with \texttt{??}  has bad side-effects and
%    is not supported (though not explicitly caught for performance
%    reasons.}
%
%    The \meta{label} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{Querying hooks}
% \label{sec:querying}
%
% Simpler data types, like token lists, have three possible states; they
% can:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item exist and be empty;
%   \item exist and be non-empty; and
%   \item not exist (in which case emptiness doesn't apply);
% \end{itemize}
% Hooks are a bit more complicated: they have four possible states.
% A hook may exist or not, and either way it may or may not be empty.
% This means that even a hook that doesn't exist may be non-empty.
%
% This seemingly strange state may happen when, for example, package~$A$
% defines hook \hook{A/foo}, and package $B$ adds some code to that
% hook.  However, a document may load package $B$ before package $A$, or
% may not load package $A$ at all.  In both cases some code is added to
% hook \hook{A/foo} without that hook being defined yet, thus that
% hook is said to be non-empty, whereas it doesn't exist.  Therefore,
% querying the existence of a hook doesn't imply its emptiness, neither
% does the other way around.
%
% A hook is said to be empty when no code was added to it, either to
% its permanent code pool, or to its ``next'' token list.  The hook
% doesn't need to be declared to have code added to its code pool.
% A hook is said to exist when it was declared with \cs{NewHook} or
% some variant thereof.
%
% \begin{function}[EXP]{\IfHookEmptyTF}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{IfHookEmptyTF} \Arg{hook} \Arg{true code} \Arg{false code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Tests if the \meta{hook} is empty (\emph{i.e.}, no code was added to
%   it using either \cs{AddToHook} or \cs{AddToHookNext}), and
%   branches to either \meta{true code} or \meta{false code} depending
%   on the result.
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}[EXP]{\IfHookExistTF}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{IfHookExistTF} \Arg{hook} \Arg{true code} \Arg{false code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Tests if the \meta{hook} exists (if it was created with either
%   \cs{NewHook}, \cs{NewReversedHook}, or \cs{NewMirroredHookPair}), and
%   branches to either \meta{true code} or \meta{false code} depending
%   on the result.
%
%   The existence of a hook usually doesn't mean much from the viewpoint
%   of code that tries to add/remove code from that hook, since package
%   loading order may vary, thus the creation of hooks is asynchronous
%   to adding and removing code from it, so this test should be used
%   sparingly.
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.
% \end{function}
%
% \fmi{Would be helpful if we provide some use cases}
%
% \subsubsection{Displaying hook code}
%
%    If one has to adjust the code execution in a hook using a hook
%    rule it is helpful to get some information about the code
%    associated with a hook, its current order and the existing rules.
%
% \begin{function}{\ShowHook}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{ShowHook} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Displays information about the \meta{hook} such as

%
% \begin{function}{\DebugHookOn,\DebugHookOff}

% \subsection{L3 programming layer (\texttt{expl3}) interfaces}
% \label{sec:l3hook-interface}
%
%
% This is a quick summary of the \LaTeX3 programming interfaces for
% use with packages written in \texttt{expl3}. In contrast to the
% \LaTeXe{} interfaces they always use mandatory arguments only, e.g.,
% you always have to specify the \meta{label} for a code chunk.  We
% therefore suggest to use the declarations discussed in the previous
% section even in \texttt{expl3} packages, but the choice is yours.
%
%
% \begin{function}
%   {\hook_new:n,\hook_new_reversed:n,\hook_new_pair:nn}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_new:n}\Arg{hook}
%     \cs{hook_new_pair:nn}\Arg{hook-1}\Arg{hook-2}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Creates a new \meta{hook} with normal or reverse ordering of code
%    chunks. \cs{hook_new_pair:nn} creates a pair of such hooks with
%    \Arg{hook-2} being a reversed hook.
%    If a hook name is already taken, an error is raised and the hook
%    is not created.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
%
%
% \begin{function}{\hook_use:n}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_use:n} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Executes the \Arg{hook} code followed (if set up) by the code for next
%    invocation only, then empties that next invocation code.
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\hook_use_once:n}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_use_once:n} \Arg{hook}
%   \end{syntax}
%     Changes the \Arg{hook} status so that from now on any addition to
%     the hook code is executed immediately. Then execute any
%     \Arg{hook} code already set up.
%    \fmi{better L3 name?}
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\hook_gput_code:nnn}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_gput_code:nnn} \Arg{hook} \Arg{label} \Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Adds a chunk of \meta{code} to the \meta{hook} labeled
%    \meta{label}. If the label already exists the \meta{code} is
%    appended to the already existing code.
%
%    If code is added to an external \meta{hook} (of the kernel or
%    another package) then the convention is to use the package name
%    as the \meta{label} not some internal module name or some other
%    arbitrary string.
%
%    The \meta{hook} and \meta{label} can be specified using the
%    dot-syntax to denote the current package name.
%    See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}
%   {\hook_gput_next_code:nn}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_gput_next_code:nn} \Arg{hook} \Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Adds a chunk of \meta{code} for use only in the next invocation of the
%    \meta{hook}. Once used it is gone.
%
%    This is simpler than \cs{hook_gput_code:nnn}, the code is simply
%    appended to the hook in the order of declaration at the very end,
%    i.e., after all standard code for the hook got executed.
%
%    Thus if one needs to undo what the standard does one has to do
%    that as part of \meta{code}.
%
%    The \meta{hook} can be specified using the dot-syntax to denote
%    the current package name. See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}
%


%  \begin{function}{\hook_gremove_code:nn}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_gremove_code:nn} \Arg{hook} \Arg{label}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Removes any code for \meta{hook} labeled \meta{label}.
%
%    If the code for that \meta{label} wasn't yet added to the
%    \meta{hook}, an order is set so that when some code attempts to add
%    that label, the removal order takes action and the code is not
%    added.
%
%    If the second argument is \texttt{*}, then all code chunks are
%    removed. This is rather dangerous as it drops code from other
%    packages one may not know about, so think twice before using
%    that!
%
%    The \meta{hook} and \meta{label} can be specified using the
%    dot-syntax to denote the current package name.
%    See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
% \end{function}


%  \begin{function}{\hook_gset_rule:nnnn}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_gset_rule:nnnn} \Arg{hook} \Arg{label1} \Arg{relation} \Arg{label2}
%   \end{syntax}
%    Relate \meta{label1} with \meta{label2} when used in \meta{hook}.
%    See \cs{DeclareHookRule} for the allowed \meta{relation}s.
%    If \meta{hook} is \texttt{??} a default rule is specified.
%
%    The \meta{hook} and \meta{label} can be specified using the
%    dot-syntax to denote the current package name.
%    See section~\ref{sec:default-label}.
%    The dot-syntax is parsed in both \meta{label} arguments, but it
%    usually makes sense to be used in only one of them.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}[pTF]{\hook_if_empty:n}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_if_empty:n} \Arg{hook} \Arg{true code} \Arg{false code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Tests if the \meta{hook} is empty (\emph{i.e.}, no code was added to
%   it using either \cs{AddToHook} or \cs{AddToHookNext}), and
%   branches to either \meta{true code} or \meta{false code} depending
%   on the result.
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}[pTF]{\hook_if_exist:n}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{hook_if_exist:n} \Arg{hook} \Arg{true code} \Arg{false code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Tests if the \meta{hook} exists (if it was created with either
%   \cs{NewHook}, \cs{NewReversedHook}, or \cs{NewMirroredHookPair}), and
%   branches to either \meta{true code} or \meta{false code} depending
%   on the result.
%
%  \fmi{what are the results for generic hooks that do not need to be declared?}
%
%   The existence of a hook usually doesn't mean much from the viewpoint
%   of code that tries to add/remove code from that hook, since package
%   loading order may vary, thus the creation of hooks is asynchronous
%   to adding and removing code from it, so this test should be used
%   sparingly.
%
%    The \meta{hook} \emph{cannot} be specified using the dot-syntax.
%    A leading |.| is treated literally.

%    Turns the debugging of hook code on or off. This displays changes
%    to the hook data.
% \end{function}
%
%
%
% \subsection{On the order of hook code execution} \label{sec:order}
%
%    Chunks of code for a \meta{hook} under different labels are supposed
%    to be independent if there are no special rules set up that
%    define a relation between the chunks. This means that you can't
%    make assumptions about the order of execution!
%
%    Suppose you have the following declarations:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \NewHook{myhook}
%    \AddToHook{myhook}[packageA]{\typeout{A}}
%    \AddToHook{myhook}[packageB]{\typeout{B}}
%    \AddToHook{myhook}[packageC]{\typeout{C}}
%\end{verbatim}
%    then executing the hook with \cs{UseHook} will produce the
%    typeout \texttt{A} \texttt{B} \texttt{C} in that order.  In other
%    words, the execution order is computed to be \texttt{packageA},
%    \texttt{packageB}, \texttt{packageC} which you can verify with
%    \cs{ShowHook}\texttt{\{myhook\}}:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   The hook 'myhook':
%    Code chunks:
%       packageA -> \typeout {A}
%       packageB -> \typeout {B}
%       packageC -> \typeout {C}
%    Extra code next invocation:
%       ---
%    Rules:
%       ---
%    Execution order:
%       packageA, packageB, packageC
%\end{verbatim}
%    The reason is that the code chunks are internally saved in a property list
%    and the initial order of such a property list is the order in
%    which key-value pairs got added. However, that is only true if
%    nothing other than adding happens!
%
%    Suppose, or example, you want to replace the code chunk for
%    \texttt{packageA}, e.g.,
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \RemoveFromHook{myhook}[packageA]
%    \AddToHook{myhook}[packageA]{\typeout{A alt}}
%\end{verbatim}
%    then your order becomes  \texttt{packageB},
%    \texttt{packageC}, \texttt{packageA} because the label got removed
%    from the property list and then re-added (at its end).
%
%    While that may not be too surprising,  the execution order is
%    also sometimes altered if you add a redundant rule, e.g. if you specify
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \DeclareHookRule{myhook}{packageA}{before}{packageB}
%\end{verbatim}
%    instead of the previous lines we get
%\begin{verbatim}
%   The hook 'myhook':
%    Code chunks:
%       packageA -> \typeout {A}
%       packageB -> \typeout {B}
%       packageC -> \typeout {C}
%    Extra code next invocation:
%       ---
%    Rules:
%       packageA|packageB with relation before
%    Execution order (after applying rules):
%       packageA, packageC, packageB
%\end{verbatim}
%    As you can see the code chunks are still in the same order, but
%    in the execution order for the labels \texttt{packageB} and
%    \texttt{packageC} have
%    swapped places.
%    The reason is that, with the rule there are two orders that
%    satisfy it, and the algorithm for sorting happened to pick a
%    different one compared to the case without rules (where it
%    doesn't run at all as there is nothing to resolve).
%    Incidentally, if we had instead specified the redundant rule
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \DeclareHookRule{myhook}{packageB}{before}{label-3}
%\end{verbatim}
%    the execution order would not have changed.
%
%    In summary: it is not possible to rely on the order of execution
%    unless there are rules that partially or fully define the order
%    (in which you can rely on them being fulfilled).
%
%
% \subsection{The use of \enquote{reversed} hooks} \label{sec:reversed-order}
%
%    You may have wondered why you can declare a \enquote{reversed} hook
%    with \cs{NewReversedHook} and what that does exactly.
%
%    In short: the execution order of a reversed hook (without any
%    rules!) is exactly reversed to the order you would have gotten for
%    a hook declared with \cs{NewHook}.
%
%    This is helpful if you have a pair of hooks where you expect to see
%    code added that involves grouping, e.g., starting an environment
%    in the first and closing that environment in the second hook.
%    To give a somewhat contrived example\footnote{there are simpler
%    ways to achieve the same effect.}, suppose there is a package
%    adding the following:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \AddToHook{env/quote/before}[package-1]{\begin{itshape}}
%    \AddToHook{env/quote/after} [package-1]{\end{itshape}}
%\end{verbatim}
%    As a result, all quotes will be in italics.
%    Now suppose further that the user wants the quotes also in blue
%    and therefore adds:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage{color}
%    \AddToHook{env/quote/before}{\begin{color}{blue}}
%    \AddToHook{env/quote/after} {\end{color}}
%\end{verbatim}
%    Now if the \hook{env/quote/after} hook would be a normal hook we
%    would get the same execution order in  both hooks, namely:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    package-1, top-level
%\end{verbatim}
%    (or vice versa) and as a result, would get:
%\begin{verbatim}
%    \begin{itshape}\begin{color}{blue} ...
%    \end{itshape}\end{color}
%\end{verbatim}
%   and an error message that \verb=\begin{color}= ended by
%    \verb=\end{itshape}=.
%    With \hook{env/quote/after} declared as a reversed hook the
%    execution order is reversed and so all environments are closed in
%    the correct sequence and \cs{ShowHook} would give us the
%    following output:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   The hook 'env/quote/after':
%    Code chunks:
%       package-1 -> \end {itshape}
%       top-level -> \end {color}
%    Extra code next invocation:
%       ---
%    Rules:
%       ---
%    Execution order (after reversal):
%       top-level, package-1
%\end{verbatim}
%
%    The reversal of the execution order happens before applying any
%    rules, so if you alter the order you will probably have to alter
%    it in both hooks, not just in one, but that depends on the use case.
%
%
%
%
% \subsection{Private \LaTeX{} kernel hooks}
%
%    There are a few places where it is absolutely essential for
%    \LaTeX{} to function correctly that code is executed in a precisely
%    defined order. Even that could have been implemented with the
%    hook management (by adding various rules to ensure the
%    appropriate ordering with respect to other code added by
%    packages). However, this makes every document unnecessary
%    slow, because there has to be sorting even through the result is
%    predetermined. Furthermore it forces package writers to
%    unnecessarily add such rules if they add further code to the hook
%    (or break \LaTeX{}).
%
%    For that reason such code is not using the hook management, but
%    instead private kernel commands directly before or after a public
%    hook with the following naming
%    convention: \cs{@kernel@before@\meta{hookname}} or
%    \cs{@kernel@after@\meta{hookname}}. For example, in
%    \cs{enddocument} you find
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \UseHook{enddocument}%
%   \@kernel@after@enddocument
%\end{verbatim}
%    which means first the user/package-accessible \hook{enddocument}
%    hook is executed and then the internal kernel hook. As their name
%    indicates these kernel commands should not be altered by third-party
%    packages, so please refrain from that in the interest of
%    stability and instead use the public hook next to it.\footnote{As
%    with everything in \TeX{} there is not enforcement of this rule,
%    and by looking at the code it is easy to find out how the kernel
%    adds to them. The main reason of this section is therefore to say
%    \enquote{please don't do that, this is unconfigurable code!}}
%
%
%
% \subsection{Legacy \LaTeXe{} interfaces}
%
%  \LaTeXe{} offered a small number of hooks together with commands to
%    add to them. They are listed here and are retained for backwards
%    compatibility.
%
%  With the new hook management several additional hooks have been added
%    to \LaTeX\ and more will follow. See the next section for what
%    is already available.
%
%
% \begin{function}{\AtBeginDocument}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AtBeginDocument} \oarg{label} \Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   If used without the optional argument \meta{label}, it works essentially
%    like before, i.e., it is adding \meta{code} to the hook
%    \hook{begindocument} 
%    (which is executed inside \verb=\begin{document}=).
%    However, all code added this way is labeled with the label
%    \hook{top-level} if done outside of a package or class or with the
%    package/class name if called inside such a file.
%
%    This way one can add further code to the hook using
%    \cs{AddToHook} or \cs{AtBeginDocument} using a different label
%    and explicitly order the code chunks as necessary, e.g., run some
%    code before or after the \hook{top-level} code.  When using the
%    optional argument the call is equivalent to running
%    \cs{AddToHook} \texttt{\{begindocument\}} \oarg{label}
%    \Arg{code}.
%
%    For important packages with known order requirement we may over
%    time add rules to the kernel (or to those packages) so that they
%    work regardless of the loading-order in the document.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\AtEndDocument}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AtEndDocument} \oarg{label} \Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Like \cs{AtBeginDocument} but for the \hook{enddocument} hook.
% \end{function}
%
%
%
% \begin{function}{\AtBeginDvi}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{AtBeginDvi} \oarg{label} \Arg{code}
%   \end{syntax}
%   This hook is discussed in conjunction with the shipout hooks.
% \end{function}
%
%
%
% \subsection{\LaTeXe{} commands and environments augmented by
%    hooks}
%
%  \emph{intro to be written}
%
% \subsubsection{Generic hooks for all environments}
%
%    Every environment \meta{env} has now four associated hooks coming
%    with it:
%    \begin{description}
%    \item[\hook{env/\meta{env}/before}]
%
%       This hook is executed as part of \cs{begin} as the very first
%       action, in particular prior to starting the environment group.
%       Its scope is therefore not restricted by the environment.
%
%    \item[\hook{env/\meta{env}/begin}]
%
%       This hook is executed as part of \cs{begin} directly in front
%       of the code specific to the environment start (e.g., the
%       second argument of \cs{newenvironment}).  Its scope is the
%       environment body.
%
%    \item[\hook{env/\meta{env}/end}]
%
%       This is executed as part of \cs{end} directly in front of the
%       code specific to the end of the environment (e.g., the third
%       argument of \cs{newenvironment}).
%
%    \item[\hook{env/\meta{env}/after}]
%
%       This is executed as part of \cs{end} after the
%       code specific to the environment end and after the environment
%       group has ended.
%       Its scope is therefore not restricted by the environment.
%
%       This hook is implemented as a reversed hook so if two packages
%       add code to \hook{env/\meta{env}/before} and to
%       \hook{env/\meta{env}/after} they can add surrounding
%       environments and the order of closing them happens in the
%       right sequence.
%
%    \end{description}
%    In contrast to other hooks these hooks do not need to be declared
%    using \cs{NewHook}.
%
%    The hooks are only executed if \cs{begin}\Arg{env} and
%    \cs{end}\Arg{env} is used. If the environment code is executed
%    via low-level calls to \cs{\meta{env}} and \cs{end\meta{env}}
%    (e.g., to avoid the environment grouping) they are not
%    available. If you want them available in code using this method,
%    you would need to add them yourself, i.e., write something like
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \UseHook{env/quote/before}\quote
%      ...
%  \endquote\UseHook{env/quote/after}
%\end{verbatim}
%    to add the outer hooks, etc.
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{Hooks provided by \cs{begin}\texttt{\{document\}}}
%
%    Until 2020 \cs{begin}\texttt{\{document\}} offered exactly one
%    hook that one had to fill using \cs{AtBeginDocument}. Experience
%    has shown that this single hook in one place was not enough and
%    as part of adding the general hook management system a number of
%    additional hooks have been added at this point. The places for
%    hooks have been chosen to provide the same support as offered by
%    external packages, such as \pkg{etoolbox} and others that
%    augmented \cs{document} to gain better control.
%
%    Supported are now the following hooks:
%    \begin{description}
%
%    \item[\hook{env/document/before}]
%
%      This is the generic environment hook executed effectively
%      before \verb=\begin{document}= starts, i.e., one can think of
%      it as a hook for code at the end of the preamble section.
%
%    \item[\hook{env/document/begin}]
%
%      This is the second generic environment hook that is executed
%      after the environment has started its group. But given that for the
%      \texttt{document} environment this group is canceled there is
%      little difference to the previous one as the two are directly
%      executed one after another (the only difference is that in this
%      hook \cs{@currenvir} is now set to \texttt{document} but
%      anybody adding to this hook would know that already).
%
%
%    \item[\hook{begindocument}]
%
%      This hook is added to by \cs{AtBeginDocument} and is executed
%      after the \texttt{.aux} file as be read in and most
%      initialization are done, so they can be altered and inspeced by
%      the hook code. It is followed by a small number of further
%      initializations that shouldn't be altered and are therefore
%      coming later.
%
%    \item[\hook{begindocument/end}]
%
%      This hook is executed at the end of the \cs{document} code in
%      other words at the beginning of the document body. The only
%      command that follows it is \cs{ignorespaces}.
%
%    \end{description}
%
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{Hooks provided by \cs{end}\texttt{\{document\}}}
%
%    \LaTeXe{} always provided \cs{AtEndDocument} to add code to the
%    execution of \verb=\end{document}= just in front of the code that
%    is normally executed there. While this was a big improvement over
%    the situation in \LaTeX\,2.09 it was not flexible enough for a
%    number of use cases and so packages, such as \pkg{etoolbox},
%    \pkg{atveryend} and others patched \cs{enddocument} to add
%    additional points where code could be hooked into.
%
%    Patching using packages is always problematical as leads to
%    conflicts (code availability, ordering of patches, incompatible
%    patches, etc.).  For this reason a number of additional hooks
%    have been added to the \cs{enddocument} code to allow packages
%    to add code in various places in a controlled way without the
%    need for overwriting or patching the core code.
%
%    Supported are now the following hooks:
%    \begin{description}
%
%    \item[\hook{env/document/end}] The generic hook inside \cs{end}.
%
%    \item[\hook{enddocument}]

%      The hook associated with \cs{AtEndDocument}. It is immediately
%      called after the previous hook so there could be just
%      one.\footnote{We could make \cs{AtEndDocument} just fill the
%      \hook{env/document/end} but maybe that is a bit confusing.}
%
%      When this hook is executed there may be still unprocessed
%      material (e.g., floats on the deferlist) and the hook may add
%      further material to be typeset. After it, \cs{clearpage} is
%      called to ensure that all such material gets typeset. If there
%      is nothing waiting the \cs{clearpage} has no effect.
%
%
%    \item[\hook{enddocument/afterlastpage}]
%
%      As the name indicates this hook should not receive code that
%      generates material for further pages. It is the right place to
%      do some final housekeeping and possibly write out some
%      information to the \texttt{.aux} file (which is still open at
%      this point to receive data). It is also the correct place to
%      set up any testing code to be run when the \texttt{.aux} file
%      is re-read in the next step.
%
%
%      After this hook has been executed the \texttt{.aux} file is
%      closed for writing and then read back in to do some tests
%      (e.g., looking for missing references or duplicated labels, etc.).
%
%    \item[\hook{enddocument/afteraux}]
%
%      At this point, the \texttt{.aux} file has been reprocessed and so
%      this is a possible place for final checks and display of
%      information to the user. However, for the latter you might
%      prefer the next hook, so that your information is displayed after the
%      (possibly longish) list of files if that got requested via \cs{listfiles}.
%
%    \item[\hook{enddocument/info}]
%
%      This hook is meant to receive code that write final information
%      messages to the terminal. It follows immediately after the
%      previous hook (so both could have been combined, but then
%      packages adding further code would always need to also supply
%      an explicit rule to specify where it should go.
%
%      This hook already contains some code added by the kernel (under
%      the labels \texttt{kernel/filelist} and
%      \texttt{kernel/warnings}), namely the list of files when
%      \cs{listfiles} has been used and the warnings for duplicate
%      labels, missing references, font substitutions etc.
%
%    \item[\hook{enddocument/end}]
%
%      Finally, this hook is executed just in front of the final call
%      to \cs{@{}@end}.
%
%    \end{description}
%
%
%    There is also the hook \hook{shipout/lastpage}. This hook is
%    executed as part of the last \cs{shipout} in the document to
%    allow package to add final \cs{special}'s to that page. Where
%    this hook is executed in relation to those from the above list
%    can vary from document to document. Furthermore to determine correctly
%    which of the \cs{shipout}s is the last one, \LaTeX{} needs to be run
%    several times, so initially it might get executed on the wrong
%    page. See section~\ref{sec:shipout} for where to find the details.
%
%
% \subsubsection{Hooks provided \cs{shipout} operations}
% \label{sec:shipout}
%
%    There are several hooks and mechanisms added to \LaTeX{}'s
%    process of generating pages. These are documented in
%    \texttt{ltshipout-doc.pdf} or with code in
%    \texttt{ltshipout-code.pdf}.
%
%
% \subsubsection{Hooks provided file loading operations}
%
%    There are several hooks added to \LaTeX{}'s
%    process of loading file via its high-level interfaces such as
%    \cs{input}, \cs{include}, \cs{usepackage}, etc. These are documented in
%    \texttt{ltfilehook-doc.pdf} or with code in
%    \texttt{ltfilehook-code.pdf}.

%                \g_@@_..._code_tl,\g_@@_..._next_code_tl}
%
%    Hooks have a \meta{name} and for each hook we have to provide a number of
%    data structures. These are
%    \begin{description}
%    \item[\cs{g_@@_\meta{name}_code_prop}] A property list holding the code
%    for the hook in separate chunks. The keys are by default the
%    package names that add code to the hook, but it is possible
%    for packages to define other keys. 
%
%    \item[\cs{g_@@_\meta{name}_rules_prop}] A property listing holding
%    relation info how the code chunks should be ordered within a
%    hook. This is used for debugging only. The actual rule for a
%    \meta{hook} is stored in a separate token lists named
%    \cs[no-index]{g_@@_\meta{hook}_rule_\meta{label1}\string|\meta{label2}_tl}
%    for a pair of labels.
%
%    \item[\cs{g_@@_\meta{name}_code_tl}] The code that is actually executed
%    when the hook is called in the document is stored in this token
%    list. It is constructed from the code chunks applying the
%    information.
%
%    \item[\cs{g_@@_\meta{name}_next_code_tl}] Finally there is extra code
%    (normally empty) that is used on the next invocation of the hook
%    (and then deleted). This can be used to define some special
%    behavior for a single occasion from within the document.
%
%    \end{description}
%  \end{macro}


%
%
%  \begin{macro}{\hook_new:n}
%    The \cs{hook_new:n} declaration declare a new hook and expects
%    the hook \meta{name} as its argument, e.g.,
%    \hook{begindocument}.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \hook_new:n #1
  {
    \exp_args:Nx \@@_new:n
      { \@@_parse_label_default:nn {#1} { top-level } }
  }
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_new:n #1 {
%    \end{macrocode}
%    We check for one of the internal data structures and if it
%    already exists we complain.
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \hook_if_exist:nTF {#1}
     { \ErrorHookExists }
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Otherwise we add the hook name to the list of all hooks and
%    allocate the necessary data structures for the new hook.
%    \begin{macrocode}
     { \seq_gput_right:Nn \g_@@_all_seq {#1}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    This is only used by the actual code of the current hook, so
%    declare it normally:
%    \begin{macrocode}
       \tl_new:c { g_@@_#1_code_tl }
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Now ensure that the base data structure for the hook exists:
%    \begin{macrocode}
       \@@_declare:n {#1}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    The \cs{g_@@_\meta{hook}_labels_clist} holds the sorted list of
%    labels (once it got sorted). This is used only for debugging.
%    \begin{macrocode}
       \clist_new:c {g_@@_#1_labels_clist}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Some hooks should reverse the default order of code chunks. To
%    signal this we have a token list which is empty for normal hooks
%    and contains a \verb=-= for reversed hooks.
%    \begin{macrocode}
       \tl_new:c { g_@@_#1_reversed_tl }
%    \end{macrocode}
%    The above is all in L3 convention, but we also provide an
%    interface to legacy \LaTeXe{} for use in the current kernel. This
%    is done in a separate macro.
%    \begin{macrocode}
       \@@_provide_legacy_interface:n {#1}
     }
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%  \end{macro}

%
%
% \begin{macro}{\@@_declare:n}
%   This function declares the basic data structures for a hook without
%   actually declaring the hook itself.  This is needed to allow adding
%   to undeclared hooks.  Here it is unnecessary to check whether both
%   variables exist, since both are declared at the same time (either
%   both exist, or neither).
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_declare:n #1
  {
    \@@_if_exist:nF {#1}

        \prop_new:c { g_@@_#1_rules_prop } % only for debugging
      }
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
%  \end{macro}



%  \begin{macro}{\hook_new_reversed:n}
%
%    Declare a new hook. The default ordering of code chunks is
%    reversed, signaled by setting the token list to a minus sign.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \hook_new_reversed:n #1 {
  \hook_new:n {#1}
  \tl_gset:cn { g_@@_#1_reversed_tl } { - }
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%  \end{macro}

%  \begin{macro}{\hook_new_pair:nn}
%    A shorthand for declaring a normal and a (matching) reversed hook in one go.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \hook_new_pair:nn #1#2 {
  \hook_new:n {#1}  \hook_new_reversed:n {#2}
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%  \end{macro}


% \begin{macro}{\@@_provide_legacy_interface:n}
%    The \LaTeX{} legacy concept for hooks uses with hooks the
%    following naming scheme in the code: \cs{@...hook}.
%
%    We follow this convention and insert the hook code using this
%    naming scheme in \LaTeXe{}. At least as long as this code is in a
%    package, some such hooks are already filled with data when we move
%    them over to the new scheme. We therefore insert already existing
%    code under the label \texttt{legacy} into the hook management
%    machinery and then replace the \cs{@...hook} with its counterpart
%    which is \cs{g_@@_\#1_code_tl}.\footnote{This means one extra
%    unnecessary expansion on each invocation in the document but
%    keeps the \LaTeXe{} and the L3 coding side properly separated.}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_provide_legacy_interface:n #1
  {
%    \end{macrocode}
%    If the \pkg{expl3} code is run with checking on then assigning or
%    using non L3 names such as \cs{@enddocumenthook} with \pkg{expl3}
%    functions will trigger warnings so we run this code with
%    debugging explicitly suspended.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \debug_suspend:
    \tl_if_exist:cT { @#1hook }
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Of course if the hook exists but is still empty, there is no need
%    to add anything under \texttt{legacy} or the current package name.
%    \begin{macrocode}
      {
        \tl_if_empty:cF { @#1hook }
          {
            \@@_gput_code:nxv {#1}

              { @#1hook }
          }
      }
%    \end{macrocode}
%    We need a global definition in case the declaration is done
%    inside a group (which happens below at the end of the file).
%    This is another reason why need to suspend checking, otherwise
%    \cs{tl_gset:co} would complain about \cs{@...hook} not starting
%    with \cs{g_}.

% \subsection{Parsing a label}
%
% \begin{macro}[EXP]{\@@_parse_label_default:nn,\@@_parse_label_default:Vn}
%   This macro checks if a label was given (not \cs{c_novalue_tl}), and
%   if so, tries to parse the label looking for a leading \verb|.| to
%   replace for \cs{@currname}.  Otherwise \cs{@@_currname_or_default:n}
%   is used to pick \cs{@currname} or the fallback value.
%    \begin{macrocode}

%     \@@_parse_dot_label_aux:nw
%   }
%   Start by checking if the label is empty, which raises an error, and
%   uses the fallback value.  If not,
%   split the label at a \verb|./|, if any, and check if no tokens are
%   before the \verb|./|, or if the only character is a \verb|.|.
%   If these requirements are fulfilled, the leading
%   \verb|.| is replaced with \cs{@@_currname_or_default:n}.  Otherwise

%    First we change \cs{@@_update_hook_code:n} which so far was a

%    Initializing or reinitializing the fast execution hook code. In

%    This does the sorting and the updates. If there aren't any code
%    chunks for the current hook, there is no point in even starting
%    the sorting routine so we make a quick test for that and in that
%    case just update \cs{g_@@_\meta{hook}_code_tl} to hold the next
%    code. If there are code chunks we call
%    \cs{@@_initialize_single:NNNNn} and pass to it ready made csnames
%    as they are needed several times inside. This way we save a bit
%    on processing time if we do that up front.

%    By default the algorithm sorts the code chunks and then saves the
%    result in a token list for fast execution by adding the code one
%    after another using \cs{tl_gput_right:NV}. When we sort code for
%    a reversed hook, all we have to do is to add the code chunks in
%    the opposite order into the token list. So all we have to do
%    in preparation is to change two definitions used later on.

%
%    For the sorting I am basically implementing Knuth's algorithm for
%    topological sorting as given in TAOCP volume 1 pages 263--266.
%    For this algorithm we need a number of local variables:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item
%       List of labels used in the current hook to label code chunks:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\seq_new:N \l_@@_labels_seq
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \item
%      Number of labels used in the current hook. In Knuth's algorithm
%      this is called $N$:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\int_new:N \l_@@_labels_int
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \item
%      The sorted code list to be build is managed using two pointers
%      one to the front of the queue and one to the rear. We model this
%      using token list pointers. Knuth calls them $F$ and $R$:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\tl_new:N \l_@@_front_tl
\tl_new:N \l_@@_rear_tl
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \item
%      The data for the start of the queue is kept in this token list,
%      it corresponds to what Don calls \texttt{QLINK[0]} but since we
%      aren't manipulating individual words in memory it is slightly
%      differently done:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\tl_new:c { \@@_tl_csname:n { 0 } }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    \end{itemize}
%  \end{macro}


%  \begin{macro}{\@@_initialize_single:NNNNn,\@@_initialize_single:ccccn}
%
%    \cs{@@_initialize_single:NNNNn} implements the sorting of the code
%    chunks for a hook and saves the result in the token list for fast
%    execution (\verb=#3=). The arguments are \meta{hook-code-plist},
%    \meta{hook-code-tl}, \meta{hook-next-code-tl},
%    \meta{hook-ordered-labels-clist} and \meta{hook-name} (the latter
%    is only used for debugging---the \meta{hook-rule-plist} is accessed
%    using the \meta{hook-name}).
%
%    The additional complexity compared to Don's algorithm is that we
%    do not use simple positive integers but have arbitrary
%    alphanumeric labels. As usual Don's data structures are chosen in
%    a way that one can omit a lot of tests and I have mimicked that as
%    far as possible. The result is a restriction I do not test for at
%    the moment: a label can't be equal to the number 0!  \fmi{Needs

%    We loop over the property list holding the code and record all

%    to us. While we are at it we count them (which gives us the $N$
%    in Knuth's algorithm.  The prefix |label_| is added to the variables
%    to ensure that labels named |front|, |rear|, |labels|, or |return|
%    don't interact with our code.

%    This loop constitutes a square matrix of the labels in |#1| in the

%    $l_A\meta{rel}l_B$ is the same as $l_B\meta{rel}^{-1}l_A$ we can cut
%    the loop short at the diagonal of the matrix (\emph{i.e.}, when
%    both labels are equal), saving a good amount of time.  The way the
%    rules were set up (see the implementation of \cs{@@_rule_before_gset:nnn}
%    above) ensures that we have no rule in the ignored side of the
%    matrix, and all rules are seen.  The rules are applied in
%    \cs{@@_apply_label_pair:nnn}, which takes the properly-ordered pair
%    of labels as argument.

%    If we see \texttt{\detokenize{->}} we have to drop code for label
%    \verb=#3= and carry on. We could do a little better and trop
%    everything for that label since it doesn't matter where we sort
%    in the empty code. However that would complicate the algorithm a
%    lot with little gain. So we still unnecessarily try to sort it in
%    and depending on the rules that might result in a loop that is
%    otherwise resolved. If that turns out to be a real issue, we can
%    improve the code.
%
%    Here the code is removed from \cs{l_@@_cur_hook_tl} rather than
%    \verb=#3= because the latter may be \verb=??=, and the default
%    hook doesn't store any code.  Removing from \cs{l_@@_cur_hook_tl}
%    makes default rules \verb=->= and  \verb=<-= work properly.

%  \begin{macro}{\hook_use:n}
%    This one is better not protected \ldots so that it can expand
%    into nothing if containing no code. Also important in case of
%    generic hooks that we do not generate a \cs{relax} as a side
%    effect of checking for a csname. In contrast to the \TeX{}
%    low-level \verb=\csname ...\endcsname= construct
%    \cs{tl_if_exist:c} is careful to avoid this.
%    In this definition use protected because the initialisation code
%    isn't expandable.

}
%    \end{macrocode}
%  \end{macro}



%  \begin{macro}{\hook_use_once:n}
%    For hooks that can and should be used only once we have a special
%    use command that remembers the hook name in
%    \cs{g_@@_execute_immediately_clist}. This has the effect that any
%    further code added to the hook is executed immediately rather
%    than stored in the hook.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \hook_use_once:n #1 {

% \subsection{Querying a hook}
%
% Simpler data types, like token lists, have three possible states; they
% can exist and be empty, exist and be non-empty, and they may not
% exist, in which case emptiness doesn't apply (though
% \cs{tl_if_empty:N} returns false in this case).
%
% Hooks are a bit more complicated: they have four possible states.
% A hook may exist or not, and either way it may or may not be empty
% (even a hook that doesn't exist may be non-empty).
%
% A hook is said to be empty when no code was added to it, either to
% its permanent code pool, or to its ``next'' token list.  The hook
% doesn't need to be declared to have code added to its code pool
% (it may happen that a package $A$ defines a hook \hook{foo}, but
% it's loaded after package $B$, which adds some code to that hook.
% In this case it is important that the code added by package $B$ is
% remembered until package $A$ is loaded).
%
% A hook is said to exist when it was declared with \cs{hook_new:n} or
% some variant thereof.
%
% \begin{macro}[pTF]{\hook_if_empty:n}
%   Test if a hook is empty (that is, no code was added to that hook).
%   A hook being empty means that \emph{both} its
%   \cs[no-index]{g_@@_\meta{hook}_code_prop} and its
%   \cs[no-index]{g_@@_\meta{hook}_next_code_tl} are empty.

% \end{macro}

% \begin{macro}[pTF]{\hook_if_exist:n}
%   A canonical way to test if a hook exists.  A hook exists if the
%   token list that stores the sorted code for that hook,
%   \cs[no-index]{g_@@_\meta{hook}_code_tl}, exists.  The property list
%   \cs[no-index]{g_@@_\meta{hook}_code_prop} cannot be used here
%   because often it is necessary to add code to a hook without knowing
%   if such hook was already declared, or even if it will ever be
%   (for example, in case the package that defines it isn't loaded).
%    \begin{macrocode}

%
% \begin{macro}{\DeclareDefaultHookLabel}
% \begin{macro}{\@@_curr_name_push:n,\@@_curr_name_pop:}
%   The token list \cs{g_@@_hook_curr_name_tl} stores the name of the
%   current package/file to be used as label for hooks.
%   Providing a consistent interface is tricky, because packages can
%   be loaded within packages, and some packages may not use
%   \cs{DeclareDefaultHookLabel} to change the default label (in which case
%   \cs{@currname} is used, if set).
%
%   To pull that off, we keep a stack that contains the default label
%   for each level of input.  The bottom of the stack contains the
%   default label for the top-level.  Since the string \verb|top-level|
%   is hardcoded, here this item of the stack is empty.  Also, since
%   we're in an input level, add \verb|lthooks| to the stack as well.
%   This stack should never go empty.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\seq_gpush:Nn \g_@@_name_stack_seq { }
\seq_gpush:Nn \g_@@_name_stack_seq { lthooks }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%   Two commands keep track of the stack: when a file is input,
%   \cs{@@_curr_name_push:n} pushes an (empty by default) label to the
%   stack:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_curr_name_push:n #1
  {
    \seq_gpush:Nn \g_@@_name_stack_seq {#1}
    \tl_gset:Nn \g_@@_hook_curr_name_tl {#1}
  }
%
%    \end{macrocode}
%   and when an input is over, the topmost item of the stack is popped,
%   since the label will not be used again, and \cs{g_@@_hook_curr_name_tl}
%   is updated to the now topmost item of the stack:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_curr_name_pop:
  {
    \seq_gpop:NN \g_@@_name_stack_seq \l_@@_return_tl

      { \ERROR_should_not_happen }
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%   The token list \cs{g_@@_hook_curr_name_tl} is but a mirror of the top
%   of the stack.
%
%   Now define a wrapper that replaces the top of the stack with the
%   argument, and updates \cs{g_@@_hook_curr_name_tl} accordingly.

%
%    As we are in a package calling \cs{NewHook} would label any
%    already set up hook code under the package name, but we want it
%    under the name \hook{top-level} so we pretend that \cs{@currname}
%    is empty.

  \NewHook{enddocument}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    We need to initialize the mechanism at \verb=\begin{document}=
%    but obviously before everything else, so we sneak\footnote{This
%    needs to move to \cs{document} directly.}
%    \cs{@@_initialize_all:} into the \LaTeXe{} name of the hook.
%
%    We can't use \cs{tl_gput_left:Nn} because that complains about
%    \cs{@begindocumenthook} not starting with \cs{g_} so we do this
%    through the backdoor.

%  \tex_global:D\tl_put_left:Nn \@begindocumenthook
