The LaTeX kernel
================

Release 2025-06-01 pre-release 0

Overview
--------

This bundle provides the core LaTeX kernel. In addition to this bundle,
a minimal LaTeX system also needs the files contained in the


- L3 programming layer (`l3kernel`)
- L3 backend interfaces (`l3backend`)
- L3 unicode support (`unicode-data`)

- Packages which must be available (`required`). These are
  - Essential tools (`tools`)
  - Core graphics and color support (`graphics`)
  - Key mathematics support (`amsmath`)
  - First aid for external packages (`firstaid`)

This file contains a small set of pointers to other more complete
documentation on installing and using a LaTeX system.

Documentation
-------------

Full documentation of the LaTeX system is provided by

- _LaTeX: A Document Preparation System_; Lamport, Addison-Wesley
- _The LaTeX Companion_, 3ed; Mittelbach and Fischer, Addison-Wesley
- _Guide to LaTeX_, 4ed; Kopka and Daly, Addison-Wesley

The distribution is described in files ending `.txt` or `.md`; briefly,
the most significant of these files are

- `README.md` is this file
- `manifest.txt` lists all the files in this LaTeX distribution,
   with one line of information about the contents
- `legal.txt` and `lppl.txt` (LaTeX Project Public License) describe the
   LaTeX copyright, warranty and copying restrictions.
- `bugs.txt` describes how to submit a bug report for LaTeX

Other documentation files include files with names of the form:

   <xxx>guide.tex

You will probably need to update your system before you can typeset
these files.  Each file needs three LaTeX runs.  Some of these are
also available as PDF files on [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org).

The following files contain further information:

- `ltx3info.tex` gives you some historical information about the LaTeX3
   project
- `lamport-manual.err` lists errata in _LaTeX: A Document Preparation System_ (Lamport)
- `tlc3.err` lists errata in _The LaTeX Companion, 3rd edition_  (Mittelbach and Fischer)

The files `ltnews*.tex` (part of the `doc` bundle) contain the LaTeX
newsletters, the highest number being the most recent.

Installation
------------

We no longer distribute installation instructions for the various TeX
implementations. All modern TeX systems include LaTeX as-standard, and end
users should in general use the release versions supplied in this way.

Release distribution is carried out only through the CTAN archives.

Requirements
------------

The LaTeX kernel requires the e-TeX extensions to TeX, which were finalised
in the late 1990s and are available in modern TeX-derived engines. It also
requires a set of common post-e-TeX extensions, generally known as the
pdfTeX additions. These are available in all modern TeX engines.
