TEST 3:  Unknown variant

! Use of \??? doesn't match its definition.

                 ! LaTeX Error: Unknown arg expansion "XX"
l. ...  }
If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.
! Argument of \declare@commandcopy@let has an extra }.
<inserted text> 
                \par 
l. ...  }
I've run across a `}' that doesn't seem to match anything.
For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.
Runaway argument?
! Paragraph ended before \declare@commandcopy@let was complete.
<to be read again> 
                   \par 
l. ...  }
I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.
