(LaTeX3)        The L3 programming layer in the LaTeX format
(LaTeX3)        is dated ....-..-.., but in your TeX tree the files require
(LaTeX3)        at least ....-..-...

The most likely causes are:
 - A recent format generation failed;
 - A stray format file in the user tree which needs to be removed or rebuilt;
 - You are running a manually installed version of expl3.sty
   which is incompatible with the version in LaTeX.
LaTeX will abort loading the incompatible support files but this may lead to
later errors. Please ensure that your LaTeX format is correctly regenerated.
