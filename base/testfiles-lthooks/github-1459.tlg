-> Adding cmd hook to 'baz' (before):
[lthooks] analyzing '\baz'
[lthooks] \baz=\long macro:->
[lthooks] ++ control sequence is defined
[lthooks] ++ control sequence is a macro
[lthooks] ++ macro is not private
[lthooks] ++ command can be patched without rescanning
[lthooks] Update code for hook 'cmd/baz/before' on input line ...:
[lthooks] Add to hook 'cmd/baz/before' (next invocation only) on input line ...
[lthooks]    <- \typeout {--> next \string \baz 1}
[lthooks] Update code for hook 'foo' on input line ...:
[lthooks] Add to undeclared hook 'foo' (next invocation only) on input line ...
[lthooks]    <- \typeout {--> undeclared foo}
[lthooks] Add to hook 'para/before' (next invocation only) on input line ...
[lthooks]    <- \typeout {--> para/before 1}
--------- same without Next ----------
[lthooks] Add to hook 'cmd/baz/before' (top-level) on input line ...
[lthooks]    <- \typeout {--> next \string \baz 2}
[lthooks] Update code for hook 'cmd/baz/before' on input line ...:
[lthooks] Add to undeclared hook 'foo' (top-level) on input line ...
[lthooks]    <- \typeout {--> undeclared foo}
[lthooks] Add to hook 'para/before' (top-level) on input line ...
[lthooks]    <- \typeout {--> para/before 2}
[lthooks] Update code for hook 'para/before' on input line ...:
