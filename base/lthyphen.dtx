% This file contains the code for loading hyphenation patterns into
% \LaTeX. Most of this will end up in a file called
% \texttt{hyphen.ltx}. If you wish to customize your \LaTeX{} system
% in respect of hyphenation patterns, write a file
% \texttt{hyphen.cfg}. If this file exists, it will be loaded instead
% of \texttt{hyphen.ltx}.  See the comments below for additional
% information.

% To produce the printed version of this file the following code

% The default file |hyphen.ltx| loads hyphenation patterns for US
% english.  If you want to load additional or other hyphenation
% patterns, you should create a file |hyphen.cfg|. This is best done
% by starting from |hyphen.ltx|.
%
% For backward compatibility, the default file, |hyphen.ltx|,
% first tries to load
% the file |hyphen.tex|. If this file exists, an information
% message is issued and the appropriate defaults for \TeX's internal
% parameters are set: |\language| is initialized to $0$, and
% |\lefthyphenmin| and |\righthyphenmin| to $2$ and $3$, respectively,
% to disallow x- or -xx breaks.
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<*default>
\InputIfFileExists{hyphen.tex}%
   {\message{Loading hyphenation patterns for US english.}%
    \language=0
    \lefthyphenmin=2 \righthyphenmin=3 }%
%    \end{macrocode}
% Otherwise, since we cannot do anything without any hyphenation
% patterns, an error message is printed and the Ini\TeX{} run
% is terminated by invoking |\@@end| (which is the \LaTeXe{} name
% for \TeX's |\end| primitive).
%    \begin{macrocode}
   {\errhelp{The configuration for hyphenation is incorrectly
             installed.^^J%
             If you don't understand this error message you need
             to seek^^Jexpert advice.}%
    \errmessage{OOPS! I can't find any hyphenation patterns for

%    \end{macrocode}
% The following example describes the possible contents of a file
% |hyphen.cfg| that will load both US English and German hyphenation
% patterns, making the former the default.
% It sets |\language| to $0$ for the US patterns and to $1$ for the
% German patterns.
% Then |\language| is set to $0$ to make this the default and the
% default values of |\lefthyphenmin| and |\righthyphenmin| are set.
% \begin{verbatim}
%\language=0
%\input hyphen % (or \input ushyphen1 if the file has been renamed)
%\language=1
%\input ghyph31
%\language=0
%\lefthyphenmin=2
%\righthyphenmin=3
%\endinput
%\end{verbatim}
%
% Another possibility is to use the package |babel|, by Johannes Braams.
% That package is distributed with a suitable |hyphen.cfg| file.
