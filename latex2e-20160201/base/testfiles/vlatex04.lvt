%120. The default \cite command was changed to put a space between
%multiple citations--for example, to produce `[1, 5, 17]' instead
%of `[1,5,17]'.  (Suggested by John Ellis.  Changed 21 Nov 87.)
%
%121. The \newcommand and \renewcommand commands left the LaTeX
%internal control sequence \@tempb \let to `#'.  While not causing
%any problem in LaTeX, it caused bugs in other people's document
%styles.  Fixed by replacing \@tempb in those commands with
%something more untypeable.  (Change made 23 Nov 87.)
%
%122. Figures were typeset with \boxmaxdepth = 0pt, which could screw
%up some macros--in particular, plain TeX's \overrightarrow.
%(Bug found by Thomas H. Cormen.  Corrected 15 Dec 87.)
%
%123. The fix for 122 broke \marginpar, so it did not work at all.
%(Corrected 3 Jan 88.)
%
%124. The \frame command put an extra space after the box.
%(Discovered by John Hershberger, corrected 14 Jan 88.)

%125.  \parskip wasn't restored in parboxes and footnotes, so it would
%have the wrong value when a parbox or footnote appeared in a list
%environment.  (Discovered by Dominik Wujastyk, corrected 20 Jan 88.)

%127.  Strange things can happen if a command like \footnotemark that
%doesn't generate in-line text appears between a \paragraph or
%\subparagraph command (or any sectioning command that produces a
%heading that's part of the following paragraph) and the following text.
%What happens is that TeX sees the \footnotemark command before it sees
%the argument to the \{sub}paragraph command, which can lead to
%incorrect numbering and who knows what else.  Any attempted fix is
%likely to break other things, so I will not try to fix this.
%(Discovered by Ed Zalta and Emma Pease.)

%%%% Footnotes are numbered a,b,c,d and footnotemarks are numbered 1,2
%%%% Is it normal? This doesn't occur if the same text is typeset without

%%%% terminated by a %%%).

%137.  The size of the circle printed by \circle{L} not a monotonic
%function of L.  (Reported by Nick North, diagnosed by Ian Young.
%Corrected 1 Nov 1988.)
%
%150. In the minipage environment, spacing between footnotes is too small
%(Found by Don Hosek.  Corrected 27 Mar 89.)
%
%151. \pounds didn't work in math mode.  (Discovered by Don Hosek.
%Corrected 10 Apr 89.)
%
%152.  \indexentry commands instead of \glossaryentry commands are
%written on the .glo file.  (Discovered by William D. Partain.
%Corrected 14 Apr 89.)
%
%153. Following minor changes made
%    \include: prevent space in \include{foo } from wiping out input file.
%    \begin-\end: detects unmatched \begin ended with \end{document}
%    \verb: the leading spaces in \verb+ foo+ will not be dropped at the
%           beginning of a line.
%Also, minor changes to \newline (\\ in paragraph mode), minipage
%environment, \tableofcontents, \listoffigures, and \listoftables
%that should produce no noticable effects.  (Changes made 24 May 89,
%mostly based on suggestions by by Frank Mittelbach and Rainer Sch\"opf.
%
%154.  A bug in the picture environment caused an extra space to appear
%in a picture if an offset is specified and the environment begins with
%a declaration that generates a \special or some such TeX "other".
%(Corrected 13 Jun 89.)
%
%155.  Change 137 introduced a problem with the \oval command.
%(Reported by David Long and several other users, corrected 7 Dec 89.)
%
%157.  A \newcommand declaration in horizontal mode added an extra
%space.  (Discovered by Jim Curry, corrected 9 Jan 90.)
