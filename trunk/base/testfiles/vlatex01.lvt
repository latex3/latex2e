%180. Fixed a number of smaller problems, including addition of
%\endinput at the end of the files. (Changes made 17 Oct 91.)
%
%182. Corrected bug in the \@tfor macro where an \xdef was used instead
%of a \def. (Change made 17 Oct 91.)
%
%183. A small internal optimization in \@makecol in the output routine:
%replaced \dimen128 by \dimen@. (Change made 22 Oct 91.)
%
%184. Added \reset@font in \ref, \pageref, and \@citex. (Suggested by
%Bernd Raichle. Change made 25 Oct 91.)

%188. Corrected typo in latex.tex. (Found by Joachim Schrod. Corrected
%29 Oct 91.)
%
%189. Removed \catcode and \mathcode definitions for non-printing ASCII
%characters, as nobody seems to use them. (Change made 30 Oct 91.)
%
%191. Added default definition of \makelabel, so that an \item command
%outside a list environment gives a sensible error message instead of
%messing up the whole job. (Change made 4 Nov 91.)

%194. Added warning message when height of single column float exceeds
%\textheight. (Change made 6 Nov 91.)

%196. Added code to make it work with MLTeX version 2. (Suggested by
%Bernard Gaulle. Change made 7 Nov 91.)
%
%197. Use of the enumerate environment in the thebibliography
%environment messes up the latter's item numbering. Corrected by
%changing the counter from enumi to enumiv as it was already
%documented.  (Reported by Nelson Beebe. Corrected 13 Nov 91.)

%error, even with the use of \protect. (Found by Chris Hamlin.

%199. Changed definition of \item to call \makelabel only once instead
%of twice. This solves a number of problems with side effects in
%\makelabel, and is even more efficient. (Change made 22 Nov 91.)
%
%200. Corrected an obscure bug in the output routine that could cause a
%division by zero when \twocolumn[] was used. (Suggested by Chris
%Rowley. Corrected 22 Nov 91.)
%
%201. Added a few forgotten \relax in front of conditionals in
%lfonts.tex and sfonts.tex. (Suggested by Bernd Raichle. Change made 25
%Nov 91.)
%
%202. Some minor changes for efficiency. (Suggested by Bernd Raichle.
%Changes made 27 Nov 91.)
%
%203. Version frozen. (1 Dec 91.)
%
%204. Fix 197 led to incompatibilities with styles derived from
%article, like amsart.  (Changed 10 Jan 92 as suggested by Bernd
%Raichle.)
%
%205. Use of a nonexisting theorem environment in the first optional
%argument to \newtheorem led to an incomprehensible error message.

%211. Changed lplain.tex and splain.tex to match the changes introduced
%by plain.tex version 3.14 on March 16. (Changes made 17 Mar 92.)
%
%212. Changed Metafont warning messages to error messages when cmbase
%is used to generate the line and circle fonts. (Suggested by Chris
%Thompson.  Changed 18 Mar 92.)
%
%214. Allocate input stream for \typein and for \@input with \newread
%to avoid conflicts with other allocated streams. (Suggested by Michael
%Downes and Bernd Raichle. Change made 18 Mar 92.)
%
%138.  A command like \index or \label could incorrectly suppress a
%space after the next \end command.  (Reported by Johannes Braams.
%Partially fixed on 30 Nov 88.  Problem can still occur if \index or
%\label command comes inside the \end's environment.)
%158. The fix mentioned in 138 was added to the comments, but not to
%the code.  (Reported by Piet van Oostrum in TeXhax V90 #42,
%corrected 2 May 90.)
%217. The fix mentioned in 138 and 158 was done wrong in the code. Also
%the problem was now corrected completely by introducing a new control
%sequence. (Suggested by Piet van Oostrum. Corrected 18 Mar 92.)
