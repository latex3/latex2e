Thanks for considering contributing to LaTeX2e: feedback, fixes and
ideas are all useful. Here, we ([The LaTeX
Project](https://www.latex-project.org)) have collected together a few
pointers to help things along.

## Bugs

There are thousands of packages and tools and the LaTeX Project Team
only supports a few dozen core packages beside the kernel code. We
also don't maintain any tools or the TeX-engines themselves! So if a
bug is due to code from a contributed third-party package then the LaTeX
Project Team is not able to help or fix the code as that is maintained
by others. As such, we ask you follow the procedure below as it will
help to weed cases where we cannot help.

To report a bug it is important to provide a short test file that
exhibits the issue. The [`latexbug`](https://github.com/latex3/latexbug)
package should be loaded at the very top of any such test file used to
report a bug in LaTeX as follows:

```latex
\RequirePackage{latexbug}    % <- first line
\documentclass{article}      % or some other class
...                          % code showing the problem
```

If the `latexbug` package is not part of your distribution you can
download it
[GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/latex3/latexbug/main/latexbug.sty).
In that case simply place it in the directory next to your test file (or
place it into your local `texmf` tree so that it will be always found â€“
how to do that depends on the installation you use).

If `latexbug` complains about third-party packages you should first
remove those from your test file. If that is not possible, then the
bug is most likely in one of these packages and you should report the
problem to the maintainers of the package instead of opening an issue
here.  However, if you think the bug is in core LaTeX (as maintained
by the LaTeX Team) even though you need the third-party packages to
demonstrate the problem, then please continue and send the bug report
to us but explain this explicitly in your description of the bug.


## Font related issues

Problems that are clearly due to using a specific font setup or a
specific font are normally out of scope as we do not maintain fonts
for LaTeX and can't help with problems in that area. Especially with
XeTeX and LuaTeX people may experience issues due to font usage that
are either due to the font itself or to different versions or
treatment on different platforms. So please use Computer Modern or
Latin Modern fonts in the test files.



## Layout and interface deficiencies

Upfront we should probably stress that 'deficiencies' in the design of
of the standard document classes (`article`, `report` and `book`) as
well a questionable but long established interface behavior of commands
is something that we will normally not change, even if we can all agree
that a different behavior or a different layout would have been a better
choice. You are, of course, welcome to report issues in these areas,
using the procedure explained below, but in all likelihood such reports
will be marked as 'won't fix'.

The reason is is that the kernel interfaces and the document classes
have been used for many years in essentially all documents (even
documents using different classes often build them upon the standard
classes in the background) and thus such changes would break or as a
minimum noticeably change nearly all existing documents. See also the
file [LaTeX2e News Issue
07](https://www.latex-project.org/news/latex2e-news/ltnews07.pdf) with
regard to this policy.

## Code contributions

The stability of LaTeX is very important and this means that change in
the kernel is necessarily very conservative. It also means that a lot of
discussion happens before any changes are made. If you do decide to post
a pull request, please bear this in mind: we do appreciate ideas, but
cannot always integrate them into the kernel.

If you are submitting a pull request, notice that

- The first line of commit messages should be a short summary (up to about 50
  chars); leave a blank line then give more detail if required
- We use GitHub Actions for testing; you can run the test suite locally using
  `l3build`
- We favour a single linear history so will rebase accepted pull requests
- Where a commit fixes or closes an issue, please include this information in
  the first line of the commit message [`(fixes #X)` or similar]
- There is a checklist in the [pull request
  template](.github/pull_request_template.md) for the various bit of admin that
  are needed: the key points are
  - Almost all changes should be listed in the relevant `changes.txt` file
  - The date in the `\ProvidesPackage` (or similar) line should be updated
    whenever the file changes
  - The version in the `\ProvidesPackage` (or similar) should be incremented
    whenever the code changes
  - The LaTeX sources include `\changes` that are typeset
  - Almost always, a code change should be accompanied by a matching test file
  - More significant changes will need an entry in _LaTeX News_
- Pull requests that are intended for the next major release of LaTeX should be
  made against `develop`; if you feel the change is urgent and requires a patch
  level, the pull request should be made against `main`
