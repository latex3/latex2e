\section*{Issues/ToDos}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Paragraphs: should be fine, but we should provide a documentation on
  how we tag them (using \verb=<text-unit><text>=).
\item
  Decide how to handle quotes
\item Produce ActualText for logos: \LaTeX{} and \TeX{} done in
    \texttt{latex-lab-text.dtx} 
\item Decide how to handle emphasis (and implement): first steps done in 
    \texttt{latex-lab-text.dtx} 
\item
  Line breaks: what is need here if anything?
\item Footnotes: Basic code done, but more tests for endnotes and similar 
    needed. 
\item
  Formulas: should be fine but it looks as if \verb=\(...\)= was forgotten!
\item	   
  The title comes out as a text-unit without further structure!
\item	   Sectioning: see \texttt{latex-lab-sec}. 
\item \texttt{verse} should not be implemented as a list, but rather as a 
    standalone block, I think. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Input}

\subsection{Sentences and Paragraphs}

\kant[1][1]


\subsubsection{Quotation Marks}

Quote test: ``\kant*[1][2]'' and some more text.
and `\kant*[1][3]' even more.

\subsubsection{Simple Text-Generating Commands}

Some people use plain \TeX, but I prefer \LaTeX\ instead.

This page was produced \today.

If nominated \ldots, I will not serve.


\subsubsection{Emphasizing Text}

\LaTeX{} offers \emph{one command} and {\em one declaration} for emphasis.

\verb+\emph+ is done in \texttt{latex-lab-text}, but how to handle \verb+\em+ 
is unclear as it can go over paragraphs. 

\textbf{strong} aka bold face is mapped to \texttt{/Strong}, but here too it 
is unclear how to handle the switch. 

\subsubsection{Preventing Line Breaks}

Anything to do here? If so, what for Mr.~Jones and Figure~7


\subsubsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes\footnote{Like this one} should be fine, as well as simple footnote marks\footnotemark{}
with the text being supplied later.

\footnotetext{The one for the mark. For good measure have a second 
paragraph.\par \kant*[1][4]} 

Question is: is this placed correctly?

\subsubsection{Formulas}

They should be fine too (and tested elsewhere). But here are the cases
covered in this section of the manual: \(a+b\) is a short formula, $x$
is a variable and one can use a math environment: \begin{math}
  a-b \end{math} though this is seldom done.



\subsection{The Document}

\subsubsection{The Title ``Page''}

The title is tested at the beginning of the document. What of it needs further structure?


\subsection{Sectioning}

In this document we can in theory test all sectioning commands other
than \verb=\chapter=, but this is best done elsewhere, to keep the
heading setup of this test in sync with the \LaTeX{} Manual.


\subsection{Displayed Material}

An example of a display quotation.
\begin{quote}
  \ldots\ it's a good idea to make your input file as easy to read as possible.
\end{quote}
I should be indented on both sides.

\subsubsection{Quotation}

Quotations with several paragraphs. \kant*[1][1]
\begin{quote}
  \kant[2][1]
  \kant[2][2]
  \kant[2][4]
\end{quote}
And now the same with the \texttt{quotation} environment:
\begin{quotation}
  \kant[2][1]
  \kant[2][2]
  \kant[2][4]
\end{quotation}

\subsubsection{Lists}

Lists come in three basic flavors, \texttt{itemize}, \texttt{enumerate}, and \texttt{description}.
Here is an example of nested lists.
\begin{itemize}
\item \kant*[1][1]
\item They can be nested:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \kant*[1][2]
  \item \kant*[1][3]
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \kant*[1][4]
\end{itemize}
Some text directly following the list.

Here is an example of a \texttt{description} list:
\begin{description}
\item[Term A] \kant*[1][1]
\item[Term B] \kant*[1][2]
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Poetry}

An example of \texttt{verse}.

\begin{verse}
  There is an environment for verse\\
  Whole features some poets will curse.

  For instead of making\\
  Them do \emph{all} the line breaking,\\
  It allows them to put too many words on a line when they'd rather be forced to be terse.
\end{verse}


\subsubsection{Displayed equation}

Basic environments are \verb=\[...\]= and \texttt{equation}, e.g.,
\[
x' + y^2  = z_i^2
\]
and
\begin{equation}
x' + y^2  = z_i^2
\end{equation}
also supported are all of the \texttt{amsmath} environments.
