\section{Introduction}
Floats in \LaTeX are blocks that can float to float areas. An example is figure~\ref{a} 
which floats to the top of the page. Figure~\ref{c} and figure~\ref{d} are in 
one float enviroment and are forced on a float page (column). The tagging 
places all the floats at the place where they are called in the source. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[alt=example,width=\linewidth]{example-image}

\caption{This is an example image \label{a}}

\medskip \footnotesize\itshape
Note: The source of the graphic is the mwe package. The red color
shows the calculated BBox. 
\end{figure}

Tables can also float. Table~\ref{b} is here forced to the bottom. They 
typically have the caption at the top of the table. 

\begin{table}[b]
\caption{Animals in example images}\label{b}

\centering
  {\LARGE a tabular (no shown)\ldots \par}

\end{table}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[alt=A duck with a pizza,page=1,width=\linewidth]{example-image-duck}

As a summary: floats can end up in various places.
