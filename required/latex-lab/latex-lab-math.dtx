% \begin{abstract}
%    This is an experimental prototype. It captures math material
%    (basically okay, but the interfaces for packages aren't yet
%    there) and tags the material (which is not yet anywhere near the
%    final state). That part is provided for experimentation and to
%    gather feedback, etc.

%
% \section{Introduction}
% \car*{Todo: update all the documentation! Both here and
%   (what little there is!) in the implementation section.}
%
% Tagging math involves a variety of tasks that require that
% math is captured before the typesetting:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item When typesetting the math MC-tags and structure commands must
% be inserted at the begin and the end, and perhaps also around lines
% or other subparts of the equation.
% \item The source and/or a mathml-representation of the source must be available
% so that it can be (perhaps after some preprocessing) be used in an associated file
% or in an alternate text.
% \item It must be possible to measure the math for, e.g., a bbox setting.
% \end{itemize}
%
% This file implements capture of all math mode material at the outer
% level, i.e., a formula is captured in its entirety with inner text
% blocks (possibly containing further math) absorbed as part of the
% formula. For example,
%\begin{verbatim}
%      \[ a \in A \text{ for all $a<5$}  \]
%\end{verbatim}
% would only result in a single capture of the tokens
% ``\verb*/a \in A \text{ for all $a<5$}/''.
%
%
% \section{Math capture} \label{sec:mathcapture}
% In the current setup
%  \begin{itemize}
%   \item |$|, |\(...\)| and |$$| grab (through a command in \cs{everymath}/cs{everydisplay})
%   if the boolean \cs{l_@@_collected_bool} is false.
%   If the boolean is true they behave normally and can for example contain verbatim.
%
%   \item All (registered) environments grab their body
%    regardless of the state of the boolean. For
%    |equation|, |equation*| and |math| this is a change as they no longer can
%    contain verbatim.
%  \end{itemize}
%
% \section{Avoiding math capture}\label{sec:nocapture}
% In most cases when an environment or command switches into math,
% the semantic meaning of the content \emph{is} math and
% grabbing and then tagging that as a Formula is adequate.
%
% But there are exceptions, most prominently with the math shift token |$|.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item  |$| can be used to center a box with |\vcenter|,
% for example in the tabular code. The opening |$| is then often in a
% different command  than the closing |$| and the content of the box
% should be tagged normally, including all math it contains.
% This means one wants to avoid that the opening |$| triggers the math
% grabbing and creates a Formula structure, and after the |$| one
% wants to switch back to normal text and math capture/tagging.
%
% \item |$| is used to place superscripts and subscripts, see the definition of
% |\textsuperscript| which uses |\ensuremath| internally. Inside the superscript
% in special cases you may want more tagging (including nested math tagging) but
% typically it is simple text.
%
% \item |$| is used to access a char in a math font.
%
% For example the |\meta| command uses internally the math commands
% |\langle| and |\rangle| around its argument:\\
% |$\langle$\textit{argument}$\rangle$|
% which gives $\langle$\textit{argument}$\rangle$.
%
% The symbols are then clearly not math.
% (Beside disabling math tagging one could also use text commands like
% |\textlangle| and |\textrangle|: \textlangle\textit{argument}\textrangle{}.
% Depending on the font that could even look better,
% but it requires that the font supports the chars, which is not the case
% for various OpenType fonts.)
% Additional tagging inside the math should be not needed.
% If the symbols need an actualtext then a Span can be added around the whole material.
%
% \end{itemize}
%
% \subsection{Options to suppressing math capture and tagging}
%  We are there providing a number of options to suppress the collection/grabbing
%  of the math and with it the tagging.
% \DescribeMacro\MathCollectTrue
% \DescribeMacro\MathCollectFalse
% \DescribeMacro\m@th
% \DescribeMacro\SuspendTagging
%  These commands can be used to control locally the tagging of math.
%  The first two are new commands. |\m@th| is a standard \LaTeX\ command
%  used in a number of places to set |\mathsurround| to zero;
%  with active tagging it is also used to identify math
%  that should not be tagged, because it has traditionally be used in exactly
%  the places where math mode is used for its layout charactistics and not for
%  representing a formula.\footnote{This way even code that is not adjusted up
%  for tagging is handled correctly if it uses \cs{m@th}.}.
%  Details are described below.
%  (|\SuspendTagging| is documented in source2e.pdf.)
%
%  To set |\mathsurround| without disabling math tagging, use |\mathsurround\z@| directly.
%
%
% \subsubsection{Using the trigger token \cs{m@th} \emph{inside} the math}
%
% If the grabbed math contains the token |\m@th| the tagging/processing
% of the math is suppressed. As the math is nevertheless grabbed, this requires
% that the end math shift token is not hidden in some other command.
% |\m@th| sets also |\mathsurround| to zero, which is often
% wanted in untagged math anyway.
%
% Text tagging is \emph{not} suppressed inside the math, e.g.,
% |\mbox{\emph{text}}| will still create an Em-structure.
% In contrast nested math is not tagged.
%
% To suppress the text tagging |\SuspendTagging{}| can be used:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item no math tagging, but |\emph| is tagged:\\
%          |$\m@th\langle\mbox{\emph{if and only if} $x=y$}\rangle$|
%
%    \item no internal tagging:
%          \\
%         |$\m@th\SuspendTagging{}\langle\mbox{\emph{if and only if}} $x=y$}\rangle$|
%    \end{itemize}
%
% The method is quite suitable for symbols and also for sub- and superscripts
% (as long as they don't contain nested math that should be tagged).
%
%
% \subsubsection{Using \cs{m@th} \emph{before} the opening \texttt{\$}}
%
% |\m@th| (as defined in the latex-lab-math code) sets also the internal boolean
% which controls the grabbing  to true and so when it is used \emph{before}
% some math it disables math grabbing and tagging for all following math
% in the current group (including nested math).
% Text tagging inside the math is still active, it can be disabled as above
% with |\SuspendTagging{}|.
%
% When |\m@th| is used like this it is possible to reenable the math
% tagging of nested math, by adding |\MathCollectTrue| after the opening |$|.
%
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item no math tagging, but |\emph| is tagged:\\
%        |{\m@th$\langle\mbox{\emph{if and only if} $x=y$}\rangle$}|
%
%    \item  both nested math and |\emph| is tagged:\\
%        |{\m@th$\MathCollectTrue\langle\mbox{\emph{if and only if} $x=y$}\rangle$}|
%    \end{itemize}
%
% The method is suitable for symbols and sub- and superscripts too
% (it is actually how superscripts avoid math tagging currently).
% It can also be used in cases where the end math shift token is
% hidden in some other command. But it is not so useful for
% larger boxes as it sets |\mathsurround| to zero.
% Grouping should be used to avoid side-effects on following math.
%
%
%\subsubsection{Disabling math tagging with \cs{MathCollectFalse}}
%
% Without a side-effect on |\mathsurround| the math grabbing can be
% suppressed and reenabled by setting the boolean that controls the collecting.
% So in the following example the math in the |\mbox| is properly tagged,
% but the angled brackets are simple text.
%
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    %stop math grabbing
%    \MathCollectFalse
%    $
%    %(optional) restart math grabbing for nested math
%    \MathCollectTrue
%    \langle\mbox{\emph{if and only if}} $x=y$}\rangle
%    $
%    %(optional) restart math grabbing for following math
%    % if there is no grouping
%    \MathCollectTrue
%    \quad $x=1$
%    \end{verbatim}
%    The method is suitable if a box should be centered with
%    |\vcenter| (and is used in array.sty for the tabular code).
%
% \section{Math capture interfaces}
%
% \subsection{Code level interfaces}
%
% \begin{function}{\math_register_env:n, \math_register_env:nn}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{math_register_env:n} \Arg{env}
%     \cs{math_register_env:nn} \Arg{env} \Arg{options}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Registers the \meta{env} as a math environment which should be captured
%   and made available. This is necessary for all top-level math mode
%   environments: low-level errors may result if these are not correct
%   set up. One or more key--value \meta{options} may also be given:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item[\texttt{arg-spec}] The argument specification taken by the
%       beginning of the environment; this is used to remove non-mathematical
%       material.
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\math_processor:n}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{math_processor:n} \Arg{tokens}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Declares that the captured math content should be passed to the
%   \meta{tokens}, which will receive the environment type as |#1| and
%   the content as |#2|. The processing is done before the typesetting. It is not
%   applied if \cs{ifmeasuring@} is true.
% \end{function}
%
% \subsection{Document level interfaces}
%
% \begin{function}{\RegisterMathEnvironment}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{RegisterMathEnvironment} \oarg{options} \Arg{env}
%   \end{syntax}
%   Registers the \meta{env} as a math environment which should be captured
%   and made available. This is necessary for all top-level math mode
%   environments: low-level errors may result if these are not correct
%   set up. One or more key--value \meta{options} may also be given:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item[\texttt{arg-spec}] The argument specification taken by the
%       beginning of the environment; this is used to remove non-mathematical
%       material.
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\MathCollectTrue,\MathCollectFalse}
%   \begin{syntax}
%     \cs{MathCollectTrue}\\
%     \cs{MathCollectFalse}
%   \end{syntax}
%  This activates/deactivates the math collection of the math shift token.
%  See above for cases when this can be usefull.
% \end{function}
%
% \section{Math tagging}
%
% \subsection{Code requirements}
% The tagging code has to handle
% \begin{itemize}
% \item the embedding into the surrounding. This means
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item closing and reopening MC-chunks
%     \item closing and reopening text/P-structures
%     \item handling interferences of the tagging code with penalties and spacing.
%   \end{itemize}
% \item the actual tagging which means to do some or all of the following tasks:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item setup content for an associated source file
%     \item setup content for an associated mathml file
%     \item setup content for the /Alt key
%     \item setup content for the /ActualText key
%     \item setup attributes
%     \item add associated files
%     \item add a Formula structure
%     \item surround elements of the equation with mathml structure elements
%          (currently only luatex with luamml)
%    \end{itemize}
%  \end{itemize}
%
%  \subsection{Inline math}
%
%  The embedding code is added through
%  the tagging sockets
%   \begin{itemize}
%    \item |math/inline/begin|
%    \item |math/inline/end|
%   \end{itemize}
%  The sockets simply push and pop the MC currently. Without
%  tagging they use the noop-plug.
%
%  The actual tagging is in done through the tagging sockets
%   \begin{itemize}
%    \item |math/inline/formula/begin|
%     This socket takes the math as second argument and its code
%     should output it for typesetting.
%     The |default| plug of the socket calls these three internal sockets
%     for the tagging support:
%      \begin{itemize}
%      \item |math/content| This should set up the various
%      content variables (empty variables are ignored by the structure code
%       and so can be used to suppress a setting).
%      \item |math/struct/begin| This calls \cs{tag_struct_begin:n}.
%      It should also write the associated files if needed.
%      \end{itemize}
%    \item |math/inline/formula/end|
%      This socket ends the formula structure(s). The |default|
%      plug calls this internal socket:
%       \begin{itemize}
%        \item |tagsupport/math/struct/end|
%       \end{itemize}
%   \end{itemize}
%
%  \subsection{Display math}
%
%  \textit{to be written}
%
%  \subsection{Associated Files}
%
%  The current code allows the attachment of two types of associated file to the
%  Formula structure:
%  the \LaTeX\ source and a MathML representation.
%  Technically both can be attached---AF is an array
%  of file references-----in practice there can be problems with PDF consumers:
%  e.g., ngpdf used both and so showed the equation twice
%  (this has been corrected in the newest version) and
%  Foxit seems to see only the first AF in the array (so we attach the
%  mathml as first file).
%
%  The \LaTeX\ source can be (and is) attached automatically.
%  It can be suppressed by an option with
%  \texttt{math/tex/AF=false}, see below.
%
%  The MathML is attached if the files |\jobname-mathml.html| and/or
%  |\jobname-luamml-mathml.html| are found
%  and if they contains a suitable MathML snippet for the current formula.
%  If the files contain more than one suitable snippet (as identified by the hash)
%  the first one is used.
%  |\jobname-luamml-mathml.html| is automatically generated (see below section~\ref{sec:luamml})
%  and read after |\jobname-mathml.html|. This means that |\jobname-mathml.html| can contain
%  improved versions of a formula.
%
%  The MathML processing can be suppressed globally by emptying the list of
%  mathml files with |math/mathml/sources=|. Locally for a formula |math/mathml/AF=false|
%  can be used.
%
%  For a MathML representation a file with such representations must be provided.
%  If the equation is numbered the numbering should be part of the MathML as
%  the |Lbl| substructure is ignored if an MathML is used (see https://github.com/foxitsoftware/PDF_UA-2).
%
%  The MathML representation is given in a special format.
%  It is meant to be a valid html file
%  that can be viewed  in a browser.
%  For this it can start with |<!DOCTYPE html><html>| and end with |</html>|
%  It should have the extension \texttt{.html}. The \meta{mathml} content
%  is read with special catcodes, so can contain ambersands, hashes, comment chars
%  and unmatched braces such as |<mo>{</mo>|
%
%  The file should contain a number of representations in this format:
%  \begin{quote}
%  |<div>| \\
%  |  <h2>\mml| \meta{key}|</h2>|\\
%  |  <p>|\meta{source}|</p>| \\
%  |  <p>|\meta{hash}|</p>|   \\
%  |  <math | \meta{attributes} |>|\\
%  \meta{mathml}\\
%  |  </math>|\\
%  |</div>|
%  \end{quote}
%  The keywords |<div>|, |<h2>\mml|, |<p>|, |<math|, |</math>| |</div>| are required as
%  they are used to delimit the arguments by the \LaTeX{} code.
%
%  \meta{key} and \meta{source} are only used for debugging, they help to identify
%  the equation referred by this representation. The source should be used correctly escaped
%  |&| and |<| so that if gives valid html!
%
%  \meta{attributes} is not required either, but can, e.g., contain attributes
%  to improve the display in a browser:
%  \begin{verbatim}
%  <math alttext="\mathbf{G}" class="ltx_Math" display="inline">
%  \end{verbatim}
%  It can also contain the name space declaration: \\
%  |xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"|\footnote{But it is probably not needed and only blows up the PDF.}
%
%
%  By default the code tries at the begin of the document
%  to read a file |\jobname-mathml.html| in the |html|-format.
%  The file name can be changed with 
%  \begin{verbatim}
%  mathml/setfiles={filename1,filename2}
%  \end{verbatim}
%  (without extension, |html| is added automatically).
%  If there is a list, all files are loaded.
%  If a file doesn't exist it is ignored, only an info is written to the log.
%
%  Currently every MathML-snippet from a file is embedded into the PDF,
%  it is not checked first if it is actually used (simply writing everything to the PDF
%  is a bit easier than keeping everything in memory and also means that
%  the snippets are one after the other in the PDF).
%
%  As mentioned above the MathML-AF can be suppressed for the equations in a group with
%  |math/mathml/AF=false|, or
%  completely by setting |math/mathml/sources=| in the preamble.
%
%  Files embedded in a PDF can be listed in the attachments panel of a PDF viewer.
%  This is probably not so useful for lots of small files (but one could create
%  collections), but as long as PDF editors or viewers don't offer
%  proper support to access the AF it can help so have them there. The MathML are
%  added by default, but the \LaTeX{} source not. This can be changed with
%  |viewer/pane/mathsource=true| (anywhere in the document) and |viewer/pane/mathml=false| (in the
%  preamble, before the external file is read).
%
%
%  \subsection{Automatic mathml creation with luamml}\label{sec:luamml}
%
%  If lualatex and the package \pkg{unicode-math} is used,
%  the package \texttt{luamml} is loaded and this package
%  will then automatically generate the file |\jobname-luamml-mathml.html|
%  with MathML representations of all math formulas.
%  This file is then used in subsequent compilations and works also with
%  pdflatex.
%
%  The generation of the file can be suppressed (in the preamble)
%  with\\
%  |math/mathml/luamml/write=false|.
%
%  If the package \pkg{unicode-math} is not used,
%  the loading of \pkg{luamml} and with it the generation of the file can be forced
%  with |math/mathml/luamml/load=true| or |math/mathml/luamml/write=true|
%  but be aware that it is then possible that various symbols
%  are mapped to the wrong Unicode code points.
%
%  The package \pkg{luamml} is still quite experimental and the output should be checked.
%  The |\jobname-luamml-mathml.html| file may be previewed in a browser although
%  you may need to add additional css or javascript declarations
%  to enable browser support for all mathml constructs.
%
%
%  \subsection{Summary of math options}
%  The following options exist to make math more accessible:
%  \begin{description}
%  \item[ActualText] An \texttt{ActualText} can be placed on structure elements,
%  but can also be added in the stream on a \texttt{BDC} marker with a \texttt{Span}
%  tag (normally an independant marker without an MCID number, it is not clear yet
%  if it can be used on a MC-chunk).
%  The content is a text string, typically one or a few Unicode characters.
%  \texttt{ActualText} is meant to replaces the content
%  and should only be used on small entities,
%  e.g., to define the semantic or the Unicode code point of a symbol.
%  \texttt{ActualText} is not supported by all PDF reader.
%  It is also unknown where it should be used at best (in a structure element,
%  or on an independent Span-BDC) and what happens if it is used in more than
%  one place.
%   \begin{description}
%   \item[enabled by default?] False
%   \item[how to enable/disable] No interface yet.
%   \texttt{ActualText} can only be added on the Formula structure element by
%   changing the \texttt{tagsupport/math/content} or some other socket.
%   For a BDC marker one can, e.g., use
%   \begin{verbatim}
%   \pdf_string_from_unicode:nnN{utf16/hex}{€}\l_tmpa_tl
%   \pdf_bdc:ee{Span}{/ActualText\l_tmpa_tl}content\pdf_emc:
%   \end{verbatim}
%   There should be no pagebreak in the \meta{content} and the BDC should be correctly
%   nested into tagging, so, e.g., a \cs{leavevmode} should be issued before the bdc command.
%   \item[Consumer support] in part and in part buggy, needs tests \ldots
%   \end{description}
%
%  \item[Alt] Like \texttt{ActualText} the \texttt{Alt} key can be used on
%  structure elements and on \texttt{Span} in the stream. It should contain a description
%  of the content and is mainly meant for images. PDF/UA-1,
%  which views math formulas as illustrations, mandates the key
%  also for \texttt{Formula} structure elements.
%   \begin{description}
%    \item[enabled by default?] false unless PDF/UA-1 is detected,
%    then it is enabled in the begindocument/end hook
%    (this will reconsidered when it is clear, that
%    the use of \texttt{Alt} does not shadow mathml). It can be enabled for
%    all engines and PDF versions.
%   \item[enable/disable] \verb+\tagpdfsetup{math/alt/use}+ (local boolean,
%   so can be used on individual equations)
%   \item[default value] A template text (stored in \cs{l_@@_content_template_tl})
%   starting with \texttt{LaTeX formula starts}.
%   \item[user value] No interface currently provided. This needs optional arguments
%   or an external setup command.
%   See \url{https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/discussions/717}.
%
%   \end{description}
%
%  \item[source-AF] The \LaTeX{}-source of the equation can
%  be attached as an associated file with mime-type
%  application/Fx-tex. The \texttt{AFRelationship} is \texttt{Source}.
%  The source is embedded without expansion. This means that targets of
%  references and macros are not resolved.
%  The files are by default not shown in the EmbeddedFiles pane,
%  this can be enabled with |viewer/pane/mathsource=true|.
%  If an A-standard is used, it must be one that allows embedded files, e.g., A-4f.
%
%  \begin{description}
%   \item[enabled by default?] true for all engines and PDF versions
%   \item[enable/disable] \verb+\tagpdfsetup{math/tex/AF}+ (local boolean, so can
%   be used on individual equations)
%   \item[default value] source code including dollars or environment name.
%   \item[consumer support] Currently only ngpdf makes
%  use of it: if there is no mathml it passes the source to mathjax.
%   \end{description}
%
%  \item[luamml] The following options make (with lualatex) use
%  of the \pkg{luamml} package. \pkg{luamml} is currently automatically
%  loaded (at the end of the preamble) if \pkg{unicode-math} has been detected.
%  The loading can be forced or suppressed
%  with \verb+\tagpdfsetup{math/mathml/luamml/load=true/false}+.
%
%  \pkg{luamml} affects all math, locally it can be stopped with |math/mathml/ignore|,
%  or by using the commands described in the package.
%
%  \item[mathml-AF] A mathml representation of the equation can be attached
%  to the structure. The configuration possibilities are rather complex as the
%  keys have to control three different  tasks:
%  The \emph{generation} of the file with the mathml fragments,
%  the \emph{reading} and \emph{embedding} of the mathml fragments,
%  and the \emph{association} of a mathml fragment to a specific equation.
%
%  \begin{description}
%  \item[generation]
%   With pdf\LaTeX{} mathml fragments can not be generated automatically,
%   but a file with dummy fragments for every equation will be written if
%   \verb+\tagpdfsetup{math/mathml/write-dummy}+ is issued in the preamble.
%
%   With lua\LaTeX{} a file with mathml fragments will be created automatically
%   if the package \pkg{luamml} has been loaded (see above).
%
%   \item[reading and embedding]
%    By default the code will read and embed
%    mathml from |\jobname-mathml.html| and |\jobname-luamml-mathml.html| in this order and
%    the first fragment with a new hash value will be inserted.
%    The list of sources and their order can be changed with the key
%    |math/mathml/sources|, setting that to an empty value suppresses
%    the loading mathml associated files completely. For efficiency reasons
%    it embeds math fragments directly, there is no check yet if the fragment is
%    actually used.
%
%    The files are by default shown in the EmbeddedFiles pane,
%    this can be disabled with |viewer/pane/mathml=false|.
%
%   \item[attaching] A mathml fragment is currently
%   attached as an associated file to an Formula if the hash of
%   the source matches the hash of the fragment. This is not a perfect test:
%   equations with the same source and so the same hash
%   can have different mathml representation, e.g.,
%   if there are references or commands or counters in the equation. This
%   will change in a future version.
%   The attachment can be suppressed locally with |math/mathml/AF=false|.
%   The mathml fragment will still be embedded in the PDF!
%
% % TODO: adapt test
%  \end{description}
%
%  \item[mathml structure elements]
%  Mathml structure elements can be used in PDF~2.0 directly.
%  In PDF~1.7. one could theoretically
%  use them if one declares a role mapping first,
%  (this can be done with \verb+\tagpdfsetup{role/mathml-tags}+)
%  which maps all to \texttt{Span}. But such a role mapping currently breaks reading,
%  e.g. in Adobe, and so it is not recommended.
%
%  Automatic generation of structure elements is only possible with
%  lualatex. It requires that the packages \pkg{luamml} and \pkg{tagpdf}
%  have been loaded.
%  \begin{description}
%   \item[enabled by default?] false
%   \item[enable/disable] \verb+\tagpdfsetup{math/mathml/structelem}+
%   (local setting, so can be used with grouping on individual equations).
%   \item[consumer support] Needs more tests.

% \section{Known current bugs, etc.}
%
% \subsection{Capture/grabbing problems}
%
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Incorrect grabbing of |$|-math when there is also
%      explicit |$|-math within a \textit{text environment}
%      that is itself within the math that should all be grabbed.
%      For example,
%       \begin{verbatim}
%        $a\begin{minipage}{1cm}$b$\end{minipage}$
%       \end{verbatim}
%      would only result in the capture of the tokens
%      ``\verb*/a\begin {minipage}{1cm}/''.
%      This can be avoided by an additional brace group:
%       \begin{verbatim}
%        $a{\begin{minipage}{1cm}$b$\end{minipage}}$
%       \end{verbatim}
%
%   \item Similar incorrect grabbing with |$$| also.
%
%   \item The grabbing, for all the display environments (and |\) \]|), needs
%       to deal with nesting: \pkg{amsmath} contains code for this.
%
%   \item The math can't contain verbatim and verbatim-like commands. This is
%   nothing new for the \pkg{amsmath} environments but changes |$| and |\[\]|
%   and |equation*| (see, e.g., tagging-project issue \#30).
%
%   \item Begin and end of the math or math environment can not be hidden in commands.
%   For example \verb+>{$}l<{$}+ in a tabular would lead to errors. Therefore
%   in a tabular a slower token-by-token grabbing is used.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% \subsection{Fake math}
% For the current state see \ref{sec:nocapture} above. The text here is mainly
% kept for history.
%
% In a number of places in \LaTeX{} math commands (mainly |$|) is used
% only for technical reason, e.g., to access a math font, to setup a symbol
% or to use \cs{vcenter}.
%
% The code identifies such fake math mostly by making use of the \cs{m@th} command
% where two methods are used for the automatic detection:
%
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item After grabbing math content the code checks if the content contains the token
%  \cs{m@th} and if yes it doesn't call the processor before reinserting
%  the content and perhaps adding tagging code.
%  This method requires that the math can be grabbed (e.g. that the end dollar is visible)
%  and that the \cs{m@th} is visible. It applies for example in \cs{@iiiparbox} where the
%  code from |$\vcenter| to |\m@th$| is grabbed an put back. It does not work for
%  example for |tabular| where the dollars and the \cs{m@th} token are spread around
%  over three commands. |tabular| needs therefore manual intervention.
%
%  A look in the list of usages (in \texttt{usage-of-m@th.md}) justifies this approach.
%  All usages are either not math at all, or related to small elements that probably
%  shouldn't be grabbed and processed on their own.
%
%  \item \cs{m@th} is redefined so that it sets the boolean \cs{l_@@_collected_bool}
%  to true. If \cs{m@th} is used inside math that has been grabbed
%  this doesn't change much as the boolean is set by the grabbing anyway. For usages
%  outside math the benefit is not so clear: The setting avoids that in \cs{LaTeXe}
%  the epsilon is processed as math, but it also prevents that the content of the amsmath
%  command \cs{boxed} is processed as math.
%  It means that if one wants to reenable math processing inside some (fake) math
%  one has to do it after \cs{m@th} calls.
% \end{itemize}
%
%  \subsubsection{Open problems}
%
%  \begin{enumerate}
%   \item The grabbing code doesn't pass the info that it detected a \cs{m@th} token.
%   This means that the tagging code has to do the same check (and doesn't do this
%   in all cases yet).
%
%   \item Commands are missing to locally disable the grabbing and processing, e.g.,
%   to handle |tabular|.
%
%   \item It must be checked if setting the boolean in \cs{m@th} really makes sense
%   or if commands like \cs{LaTeXe} should be handled manually.
%
%  \end{enumerate}
%
% \subsection{Processor}
%
% The grabbed math is at first passed to the processor. The processor is not called
% in a measuring phase (from the amsmath \cs{ifmeasuring@}) and if the \cs{m@th}
% token is detected.
% It is not quite clear what purpose the processor has. As it is a public interface
% it can't be used for internal code. And typesetting happens later and the processor
% can't really change this. Currently it is mostly used for debugging and messages.
% If the \cs{m@th} is found the \cs{l_@@_fakemath_bool} is set, so if the code
% is changed this must be preserved.
%
% \subsection{Other problems}
%
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item
%      The presence of \cs{m@th} in association with \cs{ensuremath}
%      does not necessarily indicate fakemath.  This is because
%      wanting mathsurround to be zero is very reasonable and common,
%      \emph{even when the math is genuine} (and hence needs to be collected).
%
%      TODO: this claim needs some examples.
%
%   \item User-defined environments can create problems; but this area, of
%      new, copied and changed environments, has not yet been developed.
%
%  \car*{Joseph wrote, inter alia:\\
%      My thinking [regarding] \cs{RegisterMathEnvironment}\\
%    - (New) Math environments should not be created-then-patched, but only
%    generated by a [(future)] dedicated command (\cs{DeclareMathEnvironment},
%    presumably)\\
%    - Math environments created with \pkg{ltcmd} [commands] should not be copied, . . .\\
%    - Package authors should be able to manually set up math environments with a public boolean.}
% \end{enumerate}
%
%
% \subsection{Other ToDos}
%
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item Add (some of) the math display commands that were \enquote{lifted from
%    plain}, e.g., \cs{displaylines} \cs{eqalign}(??).
%  \item The breqn packages changes catcodes and that isn't yet covered
%    by our mechanism.
%  \item \cs{intertext} is not correctly taken into account by the
%  code splitting multiline math into subformulas.

% \subsection{Regaining control after a display  has finished with \texttt{\$\$}}
%
%
%    The tagging structures have to be added after the formula content
%    but before \TeX{} is allowed to break a page. But \TeX{} will
%    automatically add \cs{postdisplaypenalty} followed by
%    \cs{belowdisplayskip} or \cs{belowdisplayshortskip} without
%    giving us any chance to take control before these are added.
%     
%    We therefore implement the following approach:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item Just before we end the formula we save away the current
%      value of \cs{postdisplaypenalty} in case it was altered within
%      the formula. Then we set it to 10000 so that what is inserted by
%      \TeX{} is not allowing for a page break at this point
%    \item
%      At this point We also normally flip the sign of \cs{belowdisplayskip} and
%      \cs{belowdisplayshortskip} so that they become negative and
%      record that we have done this, by setting the token list
%      \cs{g_@@_skip_sign_tl} to \texttt{-}.
%    \item
%      However, we only do that if both are non-negative. If either of them
%      is negative we assume that this was deliberately done by the
%      user to adjust the spacing around this particular display.
%      Again, we record in \cs{g_@@_skip_sign_tl} that we haven't
%      done the sign flip by setting the variable to empty.
%    \item
%      Making these two skips negative is essential, because the formula
%      will be added using the special \cs{postdisplaypenalty} value that
%      doesn't allow a page break even though the real value (that we
%      use later on) will probably do that. Thus the below skip added by \TeX{} will add to
%      the size of the display and not vanish into the bottom margin and
%      if it is positive \TeX{} might decide to move the whole formula
%      onto the next page even though it might well fit.
%    \item
%      Once \TeX{} has finished processing the closing \verb=$$= it has added something
%    like
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \penalty 100000        % our special value for \postdisplaypenalty
%   \glue -10.0 plus -3pt  % the \belowdisplayskip (with sign flipped
%\end{verbatim}
%    \end{itemize}
%    after the formula.
%      This means that at this that point we can retrieve this skip by using
%    \cs{lastskip} and we just have have to flip the sign again to know how to
%    correct it (no need to know whether the normal or the short skip was
%    added by \TeX{}) and the right penalty is available to us too as
%    we have saved it away in \cs{g_@@_postdisplaypenalty_int}.
%

% \begin{macro}{\@@_prepare_display_end:}

%    level. Therefore we have to neutralize the upcoming \cs{parskip}
%    since we can't  prevent it from being added.
%       
%    Actually, we could combine this correction with the previous
%    \cs{skip_vertical:n}, which would produce marginally smaller PDFs;

%
% The business end for grabbing inline math and \enquote{raw} \TeX{}
% display. Most display math mode is actually handled elsewhere, as we
% have macro control.
