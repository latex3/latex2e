% \section{Introduction}
%
%    This code reimplements the footnote interfaces for \LaTeX{}
%    offering configurable methods for layout and functionality
%    adjustments that avoid overwriting each other when used in
%    classes as well as in packages (as far as possible --- obviously
%    some adjustments are mutually exclusive). This is achieved by
%    providing a larger number of hooks (for areas where different
%    packages/classes can easily coexist with their adjustments) and a
%    number of sockets to which only one class or package
%    can write to successfully (in case of multiple changes the
%    last one wins). The latter are for special functionality, e.g.,
%    if footnote text is typeset as a single paragraph, it can't be configured
%    the same time to be typeset vertically with one footnote below
%    each other.
%
%    The interfaces are  set up to support tagged PDF, but in order
%    for this to work, all packages altering the footnote setup should
%    use the interfaces provided here and not do it through the
%    legacy methods (though there is some support for the latter as
%    well, but it will not work in all cases).
%
% \subsection{Configuration methods}
%
%    Historically, the footnote setup in \LaTeX{} was done by
%    providing definitions for \cs{@makefnmark} (format the footnote
%    mark in running text and in front of the footnote text) and
%    \cs{@makefntext} (formatting the footnote text and placing a mark
%    in front of it).
%
%    There was a default definition for \cs{@makefnmark} in the format
%    that was used by most document classes,
%    but \cs{@makefntext} had to be defined in the class itself because
%    the format didn't provide a default. As a result you will find
%    definitions for the latter in all document classes and definitions
%    for \cs{@makefnmark} only in very few.
%
%    Furthermore, to enable special footnote layouts or provide
%    additional functionality a few packages (and a few classes)
%    overwrote other internal commands of \LaTeX's footnote
%    mechanism. The commands affected in this way are mainly
%    \cs{@footnotemark} and \cs{@footnotetext}. These overwrites could
%    not be used in combination, so either the packages/classes had to
%    be aware of being loaded together (which they sometimes did or
%    tried to) or they would fail by overwriting each other
%    unconditionally.
%
%    The present rewrite is an attempt to improve this situation, but
%    of course, it will only work if all packages/classes make use of
%    the new interfaces. Fortunately, the number of problematical
%    packages altering these internal commands are fairly small so
%    arranging for updates is a realistic goal --- to achieve properly
%    tagged PDF it is a requirement.
%
%
%
% \section{Sockets and hooks}
%
%    We use sockets for those parts that can be controlled only by one
%    package or by the kernel and hooks for places where it may be
%    possible that several packages or the document class adds code
%    (typically declarations such as font changes, etc.).
%
%    Note that sockets are of interest only to very
%    few specialized packages, mainly \pkg{footmisc}, and packages
%    providing similar functionality---the current documentation is
%    therefore fairly sketchy.
%
%    In contrast the hooks are of interest to many classes to provide
%    their layout alterations in a way that it works smoothly with
%    other packages handling aspects of footnote formatting.
%
%
% \subsection{Formatting the mark in the main text}
%
%    This implements formatting the mark\footnote{Like this one.} and
%    its relation to surrounding text, e.g., if several marks appear
%    in the same place, etc.
%
%
% \subsubsection{Sockets}
%
%    None: everything is implemented through a single definition for
%    \cs{@footnotemark} that offers a number of hooks that can be used
%    by packages to implement handling of multiple marks and the
%    formatting of marks.
%
%
% \subsubsection{Hooks for formatting the footnote mark in text}
%
%    The hooks to customize the marks in the text are the following:
%    \begin{description}
%    \item[\hook{fnmark/before}]
%
%      \DescribeHook[noprint]{fnmark/before}
%
%      Executed at the very beginning of \cs{footnotemark}. Currently
%      there are two packages (\pkg{bibarts} and \pkg{chextras}) that
%      prepend material at this point (not necessarily correctly, e.g.,
%      they do not all check that they are in horizontal mode).
%
%      This hook is paired with hook \hook{fnmark/after}.
%
%    \item[\hook{fnmark}]
%
%      \DescribeHook[noprint]{fnmark}
%
%      Executed in horizontal mode and after the current space factor
%      has been saved away for reuse. This is where currently code for multiple
%      marks does its preparation (as done by \pkg{footmisc} and
%      others).
%
%      The hook is only executed in hmode, i.e., not if the mark is
%      generated in math --- maybe that means the multiple handling
%      should happen later?
%
%      After the hook a \cs{nobreak} is executed, so any
%      ``material'' added in the hook is tied to the following mark
%      unless it contains its own permissible penalty.
%
%    \item[\hook{fnmark/begin}]
%
%      \DescribeHook[noprint]{fnmark/begin}
%
%      This hook is executed directly in front of the typeset mark.
%      This is the place where \pkg{hyperref} would have added
%      part of its code, i.e., after the \cs{nobreak} mentioned above.
%      With the integration of hyperlinks in the tagging code
%      this hook may not be necessary at all.
%
%    \item[\hook{fnmark/end}]
%
%      \DescribeHook[noprint]{fnmark/end}
%
%      This hook is executed directly after the typeset mark. It is
%      used by \pkg{memhfixc}, \pkg{scrlttr2}, and
%      \pkg{footmisc}. Used, for example, to implement support for
%      multiple marks in succession.
%
%      It is \emph{not} a reversed hook.
%
%
%    \item[\hook{fnmark/after}]
%
%      \DescribeHook[noprint]{fnmark/after}
%
%      This hook is executed at the very end of the \cs{footnotemark} command.
%
%      It is a reversed  hook to pair with \hook{fnmark/before}
%    \end{description}
%
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{Additional configuration possibilities}
%
%    The actual formatting is done through \cs{@makefnmark} --- no
%    special customization support for now.
%
%
%
% \subsection{Formatting the footnote text}
%
%    This implements the formatting of the footnote text the way it
%    appears at the bottom of the page (default case), or possibly
%    elsewhere, e.g. in the margin.
%
% \subsubsection{Sockets}
%
%    To cater for different layout configurations there are four
%    sockets that can be set by a package or 
%    class but there should be only one per document setting them, 
%    i.e., if two packages/classes set them they are mutually
%    incompatible (or rather the last one wins most likely).
%    These are:
%    \begin{description}
%    \item[\socket{fntext/process} (1 argument)]
%
%      \DescribeSocket[noprint]{fntext/process}
%
%      This socket receives all material that is to be processed (or
%      stored) including color protection code and what have you.
%      The \plug{default} executes \cs{insert}\cs{footins}.
%
%      Available plugs are \plug{default}, \plug{side} (side notes), and \plug{mp} (minipage).
%
%
%    \item[\socket{fntext/make}  (1 argument)]
%
%      \DescribeSocket[noprint]{fntext/make}
%
%      This socket receives the \meta{text} as given in \cs{footnote}
%      or \cs{footnotetext} in the document and adds formatting
%      instructions to it.
%
%      The \plug{default} plug runs \cs{@makefntext} which contains
%      various hooks for customization. For most scenarios this is
%      sufficient. However, when running all footnotes as a single
%      paragraph at the bottom, then each footnote needs to be
%      prepared prior to storing it with \cs{insert} and this socket
%      allows running extra code to do that.
%
%      Available plugs are \plug{default} and \plug{para}.
%
%    \item[\socket{fntext/begin} (no argument)]
%
%      \DescribeSocket[noprint]{fntext/begin}
%
%      The socket is executed near the start of the
%      argument for the \socket{fntext/make} socket.
%      By \plug{default} it adds a strut to the footnote
%      material so that consecutive footnotes are properly spaced
%      vertically. In some use cases this is not appropriate (e.g.,
%      when running all footnotes as a single paragraph) and so with
%      this socket one can cancel the action or do something else
%      instead.
%
%      Available plugs are \plug{default} and \plug{noop}.
%
%
%    \item[\socket{fntext/end} (no argument)]
%
%      \DescribeSocket[noprint]{fntext/end}
%
%      This socket is executed at the very end of the argument passed
%      to socket \socket{fntext/make}.  By \plug{default} it
%      adds a final strut as long as we are still in horizontal mode
%      (i.e., processing the footnote text paragraph).  When running
%      several footnotes in one paragraph some additional material
%      (some horizontal glue) needs adding at this point which is done
%      with the plug \plug{para}.
%
%      Available plugs are \plug{default}, \plug{para}, and
%      \plug{noop}.
%    \end{description}
%
%
%    All standard plugs for the socket \socket{fntext/make} run
%    \cs{@makefntext} and this command contains two further
%    sockets (unless it is overwritten by a legacy class):
%    \begin{description}
%    \item[\socket{fntext/mark} (0 arguments)]
%
%      \DescribeSocket[noprint]{fntext/mark}
%
%      This socket has no input arguments but uses \cs{@makefnmark} to
%      typeset the mark in front of the footnote text. Its
%      \plug{default} uses code that examines the value of
%      \cs{footnotemargin} and based on its setting typeset the mark
%      in different ways:
%      \begin{itemize}
%      \item positive: typeset the mark in a box of that size
%      \item zero: use \cs{llap} around the mark
%      \item negative: use \cs{llap} but with a box of the given size
%      negated inside
%      \item \texttt{-}\cs{maxdimen}: just use \cs{@makefnmark} 
%      \end{itemize}
%      For most cases this would be flexible enough, but if not then a
%      class can define its own plug to specify the placement of the mark.
%
%      Available plugs are \plug{default} and \plug{noop} (no mark is produced).
%
%
%    \item[\socket{fntext/text} (1 argument)]
%
%      \DescribeSocket[noprint]{fntext/text}
%
%      This socket manages the formatting of the footnote text
%      (presented as an argument) once the mark has been typeset.  In
%      all cases we can think of this formatting is better configured
%      via the available hooks described below, so the \plug{default}
%      just grabs the argument and processes it without any other
%      action. It is really only there to allow for some fancy stuff
%      that some design comes up with.
%
%      Available plugs are \plug{identity} (default) and \plug{noop}.
%
%    \end{description}
%
%
%    The above configuration points are sufficient to implement all
%    commonly used footnote layouts assuming L-R typesetting. For R-L
%    typesetting they or may or may not need some extension (though
%    that is not clear right now).
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{Hooks for formatting the footnote text}
%
%    \begin{description}
%    \item[\hook{fntext/before}]
%
%      \DescribeHook[noprint]{fntext/before}
%
%      Executed at the very beginning of \cs{footnotetext}. Currently
%      there is one package (\pkg{linguex}) that
%      prepends material at this point.
%
%      This hook is paired with hook \hook{fnmark/after}.
%
%    \item[\hook{fntext}]
%
%      \DescribeHook[noprint]{fntext}
%
%      Executed at the beginning of the material passed to the first
%      configuration point.  Typically used to set any baseline
%      stretch for the footnote text, e.g., by \pkg{setspace},
%      \pkg{footmisc}, \class{uathesis} and others. Could be done in a
%      later hook but is a bit more efficient here.
%
%      After the hook has run, the font is established, i.e., it can't
%      be used to set a different font size.
%
%    \item[\hook{fntext/para}]
%
%      \DescribeHook[noprint]{fntext/para}
%
%      After the font is set (after the previous hook), some default
%      paragraph parameters
%       are set up
%      including \cs{interlinepenalty}, \cs{hsize}, \cs{parindent} and
%      a number of others, as some of them depend on the font
%      size. Then the \hook{fntext/para} is run which can overwrite
%      the default. If one wants to
%      change the font size, it is probably necessary to reset these
%      other parameters too, e.g., \cs{parindent}, which can be done
%      here.
%
%      Note: the socket \socket{fntext/make} normally
%      runs the command \cs{@makefntext} or some code that eventually
%      runs this command, and this then produces the footnote mark in
%      front of the  formatted footnote text. In
%      front of both the mark and the footnote text some classes have
%      placed paragraph parameter adjustments in their redefinition of
%      \cs{@makefntext}. However, there is no need to place it there
%      it could equally well go into the \hook{fntext/para} hook. We
%      therefore do not provide another hook at this other point.
%
%    \item[\hook{fntext/begin} \& \hook{fntext/end}]
%
%      \DescribeHook[noprint]{fntext/begin}
%      \DescribeHook[noprint]{fntext/end}
%
%      The footnote text itself is surrounded by the hooks
%      \hook{fntext/begin} and \hook{fntext/end}. The two hooks are
%      not paired as they are typically used independently.
%
%    \item[\hook{fntext/after}]
%
%      \DescribeHook[noprint]{fntext/after}
%
%      At the very end of \cs{footnotetext} we execute the hook
%      \hook{fntext/after} which is a reversed hook paired with
%      \hook{fntext/before}. Some packages, e.g., \pkg{linguex}, have
%      code in that position.
%
%    \end{description}
%
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{Additional configuration possibilities}
%
%    The formatting of the footnote mark in front of the footnote
%    text is influenced by the setting of the dimen parameter
%    \cs{footnotemargin}. By default its value is 1.8em in the current
%    text font (or \texttt{-}\cs{maxdimen} when the para option is
%    chosen). The following rules apply:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item
%
%      If it has the value \texttt{-}\cs{maxdimen} then the mark is
%      generated by \cs{@makefnmark}.
%
%    \item
%
%      Otherwise, if the value is
%      negative then the mark is placed into an \cs{llap} left aligned
%      in a box of size \texttt{-}\cs{footnotemargin}.
%
%    \item
%
%      If the value is zero an \cs{llap} is used without an inner box.
%
%    \item
%
%      If the value is greater zero (but less than \cs{maxdimen}) the
%      mark is placed right aligned into a box of size
%      \cs{footnotemargin}.
%
%    \item
%
%      The value \cs{maxdimen} is used as a marker to indicate that
%      no value was given and that the default should be used,
%      i.e. 1.8em or \texttt{-}\cs{maxdimen} depending on the chosen
%      option.
%    \end{itemize}
%
% \subsection{Debugging sockets and hooks}
%
%    For some rudimentary debugging we currently have \cs{DebugFNotesOn}
%    (and \cs{DebugFNotesOff}). At the moment \cs{DebugFNotesOn} only
%    shows the current settings for hooks and sockets related to the
%    footnote code and then
%    automatically turns itself off again. 
%
%
% \section{Tagging and hyperlinking support}
%
% \fmi{this section needs work (and probably csname changes)}
%
% Footnotes consist of a \emph{footnotemark} (short: mark) that is typically placed in the text
% as a superscript number like this\footnotemark[1], and a \emph{footnotetext}
% (short: note) that is placed at the bottom of the page.
% The \emph{footnotetext} normally repeats at the begin the mark as a visual clue.
%
% Tagging (and hyperlinking) has to connect the mark with the note.
% For the tagging code, we assume that every mark has exactly one associated note,
% and that every note is associated to at least one mark
% and can have more associated marks.
%
% The mark doesn't need to be visible, e.g. the typesetted
% mark\textsuperscript{1--3} denotes three marks, where the second is invisible.
% Tagging should produce here probably three \texttt{Lbl} structures
% (one without content), and an artifact for the range marker.
% If such a range is used, links can only point to the notes 1 and 3 and
% one has to suppress the linking for the second mark.
% This means that links and tagging are also related
% to the actual formatting of the footnote mark.
% In the following this problem is mostly ignored for now, but
% should not be forgotten and handled later.
%
% \subsection{Technical details for the tagging}
%
% The following sockets are set up for kernel use, when doing tagging:
% There name and/or function will probably change as they currently
% mix tagging with the link support.
% 
% TODO: review this sockets
% \begin{description}
%    \item[\socket{tagsupport/fnmark} (1 argument)]
%
%      \DescribeSocket[noprint]{tagsupport/fnmark}
% 
%    The socket is used in \cs{@footnotemark}/\cs{fnote_footnotemark:} 
%    and takes \cs{@makefnmark} as argument. It prints the mark in the text
%    and surrounds it with a tagging structure and a link. As such it is 
%    not solely for tagging and so should not be used with \cs{UseTaggingSocket}
%    as this would swallow the argument and loose the link support. 
%    
%      \fmi{describe and decide on names}
%
%
%    \item[\socket{tagsupport/fntext/begin} (no argument)]
%
%      \DescribeSocket[noprint]{tagsupport/fntext/begin}
%
%    This socket is used before the main processing socket 
%    (so before the \cs{insert} command). It opens the FEnote structure.
%    As it sets also the tl-var for the current structure and this is used
%    in destinations it should not use as tagging socket.
%    
%
%    \item[\socket{tagsupport/fntext/end} (no argument)]
%
%      \DescribeSocket[noprint]{tagsupport/fntext/end}
%
%    This socket is used after the main processing socket 
%    (so after the \cs{insert} command). It closes the FEnote structure.
%
%    \item[\socket{tagsupport/fntext/mark} (1 argument)]
%
%      \DescribeSocket[noprint]{tagsupport/fntext/mark}
%   
%    This socket is used around the mark in the footnote text.   
%    It adds tagging support but also link support, so like the other
%    tagsupport sockets it should be always active.
%
%    \item[\socket{tagsupport/fntext/text} (1 argument)]
%
%      \DescribeSocket[noprint]{tagsupport/fntext/text}
%
%    This socket handles mc-chunks around the text of the footnote. As it
%    takes an argument (the text) is should not be use as tagging socket either.
%
% \end{description}
%
%
% The \emph{footnotemark} should create a \texttt{/Lbl} structure\footnote{to make it easier
% to identify the role we use \texttt{/footnotemark} which we rolemap to \texttt{/Lbl}} 
% that should contain a \texttt{/Ref} entry pointing
% to the structure of the \emph{footnotetext}.
%
% The \emph{footnotetext} should create a \texttt{/FENote}%
% \footnote{We tag it as \texttt{/footnote} and role map it.}
% structure with a \texttt{/Ref}
% entry pointing to the structures of \emph{all} marks related to the note.
% The mark at the begin of the
% note is in a \texttt{/Lbl}\footnote{We tag it as \texttt{/footnotelabel}.}
% structure but has to fulfil no special requirements.
%
% Structure objects and the underlying properties used by the tagging
% code are initialized when the structure is opened. This means that one can not
% directly add data to a future structure
% but as structure objects are written at the end of the document it is
% possible to update \texttt{/Ref} entries in an end document hook.
%
%
% So tagging has to solve two problems:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item the mark and the footnote text must be surrounded by the correct structure
%  and marked content commands. This is not trivial
%  as there are various layouts (bottom, marginpar, minipage) and the tagging
%  from the automatic paratagging must be taken into account if one want to avoid
%  faulty nesting.
%
% \item It must detect which marks are related to which notes
%  so that it can setup the \texttt{/Ref} cross-references.
% \end{itemize}
%
%
% \subsection{Requirements for links}
%
% Links should go from the mark to the note. Sometimes it has been requested
% that links go back too, but as there
% can be more than one mark connected to a note it is not clear how to decide to which mark it should go.
% Using the keys from the PDF viewer to go back is normally better.
%
% Links are closely related to the references stored in the \texttt{/Ref}
% entry of a mark and so are handled in the code together with them.
% But there are subtle technical differences to take care of
% as links and destinations are whatsits and so must be created at the correct time.
%
% It should be possible to suppress the links both globally and locally.\footnote{
% Currently hyperref only offers the option to suppress the
% footnote links globally
% with the option \texttt{hyperfootnotes=false}. To suppress them locally
% only the \texttt{NoHyper} environment is provided.}
%
%
% \subsection{The algorithmus to connect marks and notes}
%
%
% The connection is made by comparing the value of \cs{@thefnmark}.
%
% The standard mark commands (\cs{footnotemark} and \cs{footnote})
% store the current value of \cs{@thefnmark}
% with their own structure number as a key in a property.
%
% A following \cs{footnotetext} compares its own \cs{@thefnmark} with the values in
% the prop. If there is one or more match it stores the structure numbers and removes the entries
% from the property (so in a normal document the property will never contain more than
% a few entries).
%
% This works well as long as the \cs{footnotemark} commands are issued before the \cs{footnotetext} and
% as long as nothing unusual is done to \cs{@thefnmark}.
% It also works if a document uses more than one footnote series as long as they have distinct numbering
% systems, but in case a distinction is needed it is possible to define
% a new class with its own data structure and to switch locally to use this
% class. The following three commands are used for this.
%
% The default class uses the name \texttt{default}
%
% \begin{function}{\fnote_class_new:nn}
% \begin{syntax}
% \cs{fnote_class_new:nn}\Arg{name}\Arg{key/value option}
% \end{syntax}
%   This declaration sets up the needed data structure. Currently this only
%   consists of a property list which is used to store and manage the mark values.
%   There are no options yet.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\fnote_mark_gput:nn,\fnote_mark_gput:no,\fnote_mark_gput:oo}
% \begin{syntax}
% \cs{fnote_mark_gput:nn}\Arg{mark}\Arg{class name}
% \end{syntax}
%   This command stores the current structure number as key and the \meta{mark} as
%   value in the property list associated with the \meta{class name}.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}{\fnote_mark_gpop_all:nnN}
% \begin{syntax}
% \cs{fnote_mark_gpop_all:nnN}\Arg{mark}\Arg{class name}\meta{sequence}
% \end{syntax}
% This command stores all the keys/structure numbers whose value in the
% property list for \meta{class name} are equal to \meta{mark}
% into the sequence \meta{sequence} and then removes them from the property list. 
% The content of the sequence can then be
% used to create link targets and references.
% \end{function}
%
%
% \subsubsection{\cs{footref}}
%
% \cs{footref} uses internally the same command to set the mark as \cs{footnotemark}, it only
% defines \cs{@thefnmark} differently. This \cs{@thefnmark} is not suitable for the method described
% above: as it contains a reference command it can't be used to match a note, also \cs{footref} can
% be used after the note has already been set. \cs{footref} disables therefore the automatic detection.
%
% Instead the \cs{label} command is 
% extended in the \cs{footnotetext} command to also store the structure number and \cs{footref} retrieves this
% number to setup the reference and the link.
%
% The structure related to the \cs{footref} is added to the end of the \texttt{/Ref} array of the note and so the
% \texttt{/Ref} array doesn't necessarily reflect the order of the marks in the document. It would probably
% be possible to change this, but it is not clear if it actually matters and so it worth the additional coding
% and processing.
%
% \subsubsection{\cs{footnotemark} after \cs{footnotetext}}
%
% The automatic detection doesn't work if a \cs{footnotemark} is issued after
% the \cs{footnotetext} it refers to. There will be no error, but neither the link nor
% the \texttt{/Ref} will connect both.
%
% The simple way to handle this is to use a label and \cs{footref}:
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% \footnotetext{\label{fn:a}text} ... \footref{fn:a}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% An alternative would be to extend the syntax of \cs{footnotemark} and
% \cs{footnotetext} to allow to add a label which can then be used.
% For example
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% \footnotetext[label=fn:a]{text} ... \footnotemark[label=fn:a]
% \end{verbatim}
%
% As both have already an optional argument, that requires the optional argument extension.
%
%
% \subsection{Links}
%
% The structure numbers detected for the \texttt{/Ref} are also used for links:
% even if tagging is not activated the tagging commands are defined through
% the \pkg{tagpdf-base} package
% and the structure commands increase the structure counter and this info can be used.
%
% A \cs{footnotetext} creates a bunch of destinations (in most cases this sums up to
% two destinations): one for every structure number in the \texttt{/Ref} (used as target
% by the mark commands) and one for the structure number of the footnotetext itself
% (used as target by \cs{footref}s commands).
%
% \subsection{Implementation details regarding tagging}
%
% \subsection{Handling the mark}
%
% The mark in the text is handled by assigning an appropriate
% plug to the socket \socket{tagsupport/fnmark}.
%  It takes one argument, \cs{@makefnmark}, the
% command which formats the mark, and surrounds it by link and tagging
% commands.  At the point where the socket is
% executed, \cs{@thefnmark} has already been defined and can be used to
% setup the reference detections.
%
%
% \subsection{Handling the footnotetext}
%
% The main part is done by assigning a different plug to socket \socket{tagsupport/fntext/begin}
% and \socket{tagsupport/fntext/end}
% surrounding the footnote text.
% These sockets are used to start and end the structure and
% attempt to detect to which mark the note is related.
%
% The actual typesetting of the note text is done by
% \cs{fnote_makefntext:n} (or its \LaTeXe{} name \cs{@makefntext}). In
% the new implementation this contains two further kernel sockets for tagging:
% \socket{tagsupport/fntext/mark} and
% \socket{tagsupport/fntext/text}. They get plugs assigned that add the
% tagging commands around note mark and note text.
%
% \subsection{Footnotes in minipages}
%
% In minipages the \cs{footnote} command uses a special marker
% (small italic letters by default) and puts the
% footnote text at the bottom of the box. The \cs{footnotemark}
% command uses the standard footnote counter and marker (and so typically
% creates a superscript number).
% It is meant to be used with a \cs{footnotetext} \emph{outside}
% the minipage to create a footnote mark which refers to a footnote text
% at the bottom of the page.
% This means to repeat a footnote marker in a minipage you should use the \cs{footref} command.
%
% Tagging works quite similar to normal footnotes if the new definition is used
% and if the minipage code is changed to use the new configuration point.
% The main problem here is currently the tagging of the minipage itself.
%
% \section{TODOs}
%
% \begin{itemize}
%
% \item Special formatting of footnote marks in the text, e.g. if ranges or commas are
% used require special care as they should normally mark up such text as artifacts and
% perhaps have to insert empty structures to represent an invisible mark. This must be coordinated
% with the relevant packages and classes.
%
% \item manyfoot doesn't work correctly and must be analyzed.
%
% \item \pkg{memoir} is not supported at all and errors when the code tries to patch
% \cs{@makefntext}.

% \subsubsection{Making documents use the new \cs{@makefntext}}
%
%  If the definition for \cs{@makefntext} is that of the standard
%  classes then replace it with \cs{fnote_makefntext:n}, otherwise
%  try to patch the definition used in the class.
%
%  Here is the definition the way it is in
%  \texttt{classes.dtx}. Notice that (for saving space) there is no
%  space after \texttt{em} to terminate the assignment. We need to
%  mimic that, otherwise a test would return false even if the
%  definition has not been modified.
%
%
% \begin{macro}[no-user-doc]{\old@std@class@makefntext}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand\old@std@class@makefntext[1]{%
    \parindent 1em%
    \noindent
    \hb@xt@1.8em{\hss\@makefnmark}#1}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
%    Here is the messy code for patching. Note that this is only there
%    to help classes along that aren't updated yet so it does some
%    minimal patching to hopefully add kernel configuration hooks in the
%    right place while otherwise leaving the legacy code alone. An
%    updated class would not redefine \cs{@makefntext} but simply add
%    appropriate code to the provided hooks.
%
%    What it does is roughly the
%    following: It looks for a definition of \cs{@makefntext} of the form
%\begin{verbatim}
%  {AAA \hbox BBB { CCC } DDD #1 EEE }
%\end{verbatim}
%    where ``BBB'' is something like \texttt{to 1em} or similar. It then
%    replaces that with
%\begin{verbatim}
%  {AAA \UseSocket{tagsupport/fntext/mark}{\hbox BBB { CCC }} DDD
%       \UseSocket{tagsupport/fntext/text}{#1} EEE }
%\end{verbatim}
%    The patching is not very careful, i.e., it assumes there is only
%    one \verb=#1= in the replacement text and that the first \cs{hbox} found
%    is the right one to patch. But that is enough to cater for all
%    definitions of \cs{@makefntext} out there in the TL distribution.
%
%    If \cs{hbox} is not found it tries the same looking for
%    \cs{hb@xt@} which is what some classes use and if that is not
%    found either it assume that this is a version that uses
%    \cs{@makefnmark} without surrounding it in a box and if that
%    fails it gives up with an \cs{ERROR} (which needs to get a proper definition).
%    \begin{macrocode}
\tl_new:N \l_@@_patch_tl

  }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    If \cs{@makefntext} contains \cs{hbox} then grab ``AAA'' as
%    \verb=#1= and ``BBB'' (up to the open \texttt{\{})  and return it as
%\begin{verbatim}
%   AAA  \@makefntext@processX { \hbox BBB }
%\end{verbatim}
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new:Npn \@@_patch_hbox:w #1 \hbox #2 #
  { \exp_stop_f: #1 \@makefntext@processX { \hbox #2 } }
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Same for the other cases.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new:Npn \@@_patch_hb@xt@:w #1 \hb@xt@ #2 #
  { \exp_stop_f: #1 \@makefntext@processX { \hb@xt@ #2 } }
%    \end{macrocode}

%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new:Npn \@@_patch_makebox:w #1 \makebox #2 #
  { \exp_stop_f: #1 \@makefntext@processX { \makebox #2 } }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    If the definition contains neither \cs{hbox}, \cs{hb@xt@} nor \cs{makebox},
%    we see if it contains \cs{@makefnmark} and if so put the socket
%    before that.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new:Npn \@@_patch_@makefnmark:w #1 \@makefnmark
  { \exp_stop_f: #1 \@makefntext@processX { \use:n } { \@makefnmark } }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    The code provided by Bruno above expects 2 arguments but we need a
%    different structure so this is a simple reshuffling. Would be
%    better if we can patch the right structure in directly, but I'm
%    not a patch person, so this is the simple way out for now:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new:Npn \@makefntext@processX #1#2{\UseSocket{tagsupport/fntext/mark}{#1{#2}}}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    At \verb=\begin{document}= check if the current definition is
%    that of the standard classes and if so replace it by
%    \cs{fnote_makefntext:n} otherwise try and patch the definition
%    made by some class or package
%    using the approach above.

% \subsubsection{Enabling tagging and links for the mark command}
%
%
% \begin{plugdecl}{FEMark}
%
%    To handle the mark in the text, we define a special plug for
%    the socket \socket{tagsupport/fnmark} that receives
%    \cs{@makefntext} as its argument.  At this time \cs{@thefnmark}
%    is already set.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\NewSocketPlug{tagsupport/fnmark}{FEMark}
  {
%    \end{macrocode}
%    End an open mc and start the structure.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \tag_mc_end_push:
    \tag_struct_begin:n { tag=footnotemark }
%    \end{macrocode}
%  The associated note is either auto detected
%  or given by the user.
%    \begin{macrocode}
     \bool_if:NTF \l_@@_autodetect_bool
      {
%    \end{macrocode}
%    For the auto detecting we store the structure number
%    and \cs{@thefnmark} inside a prop and set
%    the target name of the link to the current structure number.
%    TODO: this should be usable for other footnote types
%    which means the name of the prop shouldn't be fix.
%    \begin{macrocode}
        \fnote_mark_gput:oo {\@thefnmark}{\l_fnote_type_tl}
        \tl_set:Ne \l_@@_linktarget_tl {footnote*.\tag_get:n{struct_num}}
      }
%    \end{macrocode}
%  If there is no autodetecting we need some id,
%  currently it is called \cs{l__fnote_currentlabel_tl}.
%  the Ref is set by looking at the label value.
%  We must also add the current structure number to the \texttt{/Ref} of the FEnote.
%  Both must be delayed as we don't know if the objects of the FEnote and the mark
%  have already been created.
%    \begin{macrocode}
      {
        \hook_gput_code:nne {tagpdf/finish/before} {tagpdf/footnote}
         {
           \exp_not:N\fnote_gput_refs:ee
            { \tag_get:n{struct_num} }
            { \property_ref:ee{ @@/\l_@@_currentlabel_tl } {fnote/struct} }
         }
%    \end{macrocode}
%    in this case we set the name of the linktarget in the note
%    to the structure number of the text mark.
%    \begin{macrocode}
        \tl_set:Ne \l_@@_linktarget_tl {footnote*.\property_ref:ee {@@/\l_@@_currentlabel_tl} {fnote/struct}}
      }
%    \end{macrocode}
% And now the actual content
%    \begin{macrocode}
     \tag_mc_begin:n{tag=Lbl}
     %
     \bool_if:NTF \l_fnote_link_bool
      {
        \exp_args:No
           \hyper@linkstart
           { \l_fnote_link_type_tl }
           { \l_@@_linktarget_tl }
           #1
           \hyper@linkend
      }
      { #1 }
    \tag_mc_end:
    \tag_struct_end:
    \tag_mc_begin_pop:n{}
   }
%    \end{macrocode}
% At last assign the plug:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\AssignSocketPlug{tagsupport/fnmark}{FEMark}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{plugdecl}
%
%
%
%
% \subsubsection{The footnote text}

% We need a public command to append values to the Ref keys
% \begin{macro}[no-user-doc]{\@@_gput_ref:nn,\fnote_gput_refs:nn,\fnote_gput_refs:ee}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_gput_ref:nn #1 #2 %#1 the structure number receiving the ref #2
  {
    \tag_struct_gput:nnn {#1}{ref_num}{#2}
  }
\cs_new_protected:Npn \fnote_gput_refs:nn #1 #2 % pair of numbers
  {
    \@@_gput_ref:nn {#1}{#2}
    \@@_gput_ref:nn {#2}{#1}

%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% kernel hooks for tagging
% this sets the structure around the whole text
%
%
% \begin{plugdecl}{FENote}
%    \begin{macrocode}

  {
    \tag_mc_end_push:
%    \end{macrocode}

%    \begin{macrocode}

          { 
            tag=footnote,
%    \end{macrocode}
% We add 0 for now to ensure to get a number even if the sec code is not loaded
% or if the seq is empty (which it shouldn't unless there is an coding error) 
%    \begin{macrocode}
            parent=\int_max:nn{2}{\tag_get:n{current_Sect}+0} 
          }
      }  
%    \end{macrocode}
% Store the current structure number for labels.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \tl_set:Ne \l_@@_currentstruct_tl { \tag_get:n{struct_num} }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% after we have opened the structure we can use the structure number to
% try to detect the connected marks. As with the marks we assume that sometimes
% no auto detection is done.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \bool_if:NTF \l_@@_autodetect_bool
      {
%    \end{macrocode}
% find open marks with identical \cs{@thefnmark}
%    \begin{macrocode}
        \fnote_mark_gpop_all:ooN { \@thefnmark }{ \l_fnote_type_tl } \l_@@_currentrefs_seq
%    \end{macrocode}
% Then we store the object numbers of the marks in the /Ref of the FENote structure:
% and the number of the FEnote into the marks structure:
%    \begin{macrocode}
       \seq_map_inline:Nn \l_@@_currentrefs_seq
         {
           \fnote_gput_refs:ee {##1}{ \l_@@_currentstruct_tl }
         }
      }
%    \end{macrocode}
% If no auto detection is done
% \begin{NOTE}{UF}
% TODO: decide what to do here: some label in the optional argument?
% or refer to \cs{footref}
% \end{NOTE}
%    \begin{macrocode}
      {%no auto

      }
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
% This finish the setup of the tagging structure.
% \end{plugdecl}



% Now we process the text. The destinations for the links are set with the label
% so that we can be sure that we are in hmode.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\NewSocketPlug{tagsupport/fntext/end}{FENote}
  {
    \tag_struct_end:
    \tag_mc_begin_pop:n{}
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
% At last assign the plugs:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\AssignSocketPlug{tagsupport/fntext/begin}{FENote}  
\AssignSocketPlug{tagsupport/fntext/end}{FENote}  
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% The kernel socket \socket{tagsupport/fntext/mark} is  responsible for

%
% TODO check if additional kernel configuration points are needed.

%
%
%
%^^A      If tagging is produced this configuration point is also
%^^A      responsible for surrounding the mark with the appropriate tags
%^^A      marking the mark as an Lbl. It does this using the 
%^^A      \socket{tagsupport/fntext/mark} socket.
%
% \begin{plugdecl}{FENoteLbl}
%    This plug creates the label in the note on the bottom.
%    It also adds link targets for the hyperlinking.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\NewSocketPlug{tagsupport/fntext/mark}{FENoteLbl}
  {
    \tag_mc_end_push:
%    \end{macrocode}
%     We create a link target for every related mark. The name is
%    \texttt{footnote*} \meta{structure number of the mark}. We also add a link
%    target for the current structure (for \cs{footref}).
%    \begin{macrocode}
     %\seq_show:N\l_@@_currentrefs_seq
     \seq_map_inline:Nn\l_@@_currentrefs_seq {\MakeLinkTarget*{footnote*.##1}}
     \MakeLinkTarget*{footnote*.\l_@@_currentstruct_tl}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Now we add the tagging commands. We move the structure of the label to
%    the begin of the footnote structure.
%    \begin{macrocode}
     \tag_struct_begin:n { tag=footnotelabel,parent=\l_@@_currentstruct_tl,firstkid }

%
%
%^^A      If tagging is produced this configuration point is also

%^^A      the socket \socket{tagsupport/fntext/text}.
%
% \begin{plugdecl}{FENotetext}
%
%    This plug is for the kernel socket \socket{tagsupport/fntext/text}

%    The above code may look a bit odd: the \cs{stepcounter} sets the
%    counter to zero and then we alter it if it is not zero.  The
%    reason is that \cs{stepcounter} resets other counters and when
%    perpage is loaded this results in updating counters on the reset
%    list to 1 (or to a higher starting value if \cs{MakePerPage} is
%    used with an optional argument, which is precisely the problem
%    here). By subtracting 1 in that case we set it back to 1 lower
%    than the starting value.
