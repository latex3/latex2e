\section{Overview}


Standard list types are \texttt{itemize}, \texttt{enumerate} and
\texttt{description}. By default they can be nested into each other
(also mixed) with four levels of itemize/enumerate and up to 6 levels
total (all that is customizable and can be enlarged.

Other display blocks that can be nested in are \texttt{quote} and
\texttt{quotation} --- they share the nesting restriction of 6 levels.

Furthermore there are other displayblocks that do not increase the
nesting level, for example, \texttt{verbatim}.

To visually identify example text from additional comments the example
texts are shown in blue.

  \item Third item
\end{enumerate}
\item Third item
\end{itemize}

\end{example}



\subsection{Relation between display blocks and the outer paragraph}

\setlength\partopsep{10pt}

In \LaTeX{} displays live (conceptually) inside paragraphs, that is,
they can have text before and/or after that belong to the same
paragraph. This makes semantically a lot of sense because a single
paragraph may contain displays even inside a single sentence so that
the complete text is a natural single paragraph.
This means
we have different cases:
\begin{description}
  \item[Display as separate block] To get uniform cases and simply
    prcessing such a display is is always wrapped inside a paragraph
    even though it is the only child of that paragraph.
    
  \item[Display inside paragraph] The display is a child of a
    \texttt{P} with paragraph content before and after the display.
    
  \item[Display ending a paragraph] The display is a child of a
    \texttt{P} with paragraph content before the display. After the
    display the \texttt{P} structure is closed.
    
  \item[Display starting a paragraph] When encountering the display in
    \LaTeX{} a \texttt{P} structure is opened and the display is made
    the first child of \texttt{P} followed by further content of
    \texttt{P}.

    This is a seldom encountered case (but not impossible), normally
    displays either have textual content before them or full
    paragraphs before and after.
\end{description}

The PDF tag set supports that naturally for structures like lists but
(strangely enough) it believes that display quotes form their own
blocks and can't be embeeded directly into \texttt{P}, which, if you
look a bit around in real world writing, is clearly a limitation that
does not support semantic reality.

To enable the above semantic concepts it is therefore necessary to tag
quotations using \texttt{Figure} \texttt{BlockQuote} as a compromize to
obey the structural limiations.

Similarly, verbatim displays are tagged using \texttt{Figure} plus
\texttt{Code} (for each line).

The different scenarios outlined above a exemplified using lists in
the next sections.



\subsubsection{List as its own block}



The separation is made deliberately large in this document to show
that is hasn't applied to the previous examples.

\begin{example}

\kant*[2][1]

\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}

\kant*[2][2]

\end{example}

\subsubsection{List as part of a single paragraph}

\begin{example}

\kant*[2][1]
\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}
\kant*[2][2]


This paragraph consists of text in front of the list, then the list
\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}
and then more text finishing the paragraph.

\end{example}


\subsubsection{List ending a paragraph}

\begin{example}

\kant*[2][1]
\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}

Here the text following is not part of the paragraph!
\kant*[2][2]

\end{example}



\subsubsection{List starting a paragraph}

This is the somewhat odd case and might indicate an input error in
\LaTeX{} (most of the times at least) and should perhaps be changed
(not to apply partopsep at the bottom or offer it at least). There
are, however, some use cases where it seems reasonable to a display
starting a paragraph that continues after it.

\begin{example}

\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}
This text is still part of the paragraph that was started with the list.

\end{example}


\subsection{Flattening display block}

Instead of wrapping display blocks in a \texttt{Figure} structure to
allow embedding them into a paragraph (as we did with quoations) one
can take the easy way out and ignore the textual semantics:
\begin{itemize}
\item when enountering a display block end any current paragraph structure
\item tag the display block
\item start a new \texttt{P} structure for text that follows the display.
\end{itemize}
Depending on the circumstances that might be the right way to proceed
without loosing semantics (and it certainly the model behind HTML and
also the PDF tag set). In other case it most certainly isn't. So
perhaps one needs both with configuration options..

To experiment with this, we have implemented the environments
\texttt{flushleft}, \texttt{flushright}, \texttt{center} in this way,
because they are used (most of the time) in situations where this is
appropriate.

\subsubsection{An example of a flattened displayblock}

This is a repeat of the example for quote and quotation from section~\ref{sec:quote} but using
\texttt{center} and \texttt{flushright} instead to show the difference.

\begin{example}

\kant*[1][1]
\begin{center}
\kant[2][1]
\end{center}
text continuation of the same paragraph \ldots\ and here a quotation environment:
\begin{flushright}
\kant[2][2]
\end{flushright}
and final text in the paragraph explaining the quotations \ldots

\end{example}

Here this is tagged as five paragraphs with attribute classes attached to it to indicate ``center'' etc.

\subsection{What is an item?}

Items in lists are considered (sub?)pararaphs, e.g., if more than one
``paragraph'' structure inside you will have visual separation, by
indentation and/or vertical spacing (in the example only the
latter). This does \textbf{not} alter the interpretation after the
list, in the example the whole text with the list inside is considered
a single paragraph.

\subsubsection{Example}

\begin{example}

\kant*[2][1]
\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item \kant*[2][2]

  \kant*[2][3]

  \kant*[2][4]
\item Third item. \par Second pararagraph of item.
\end{itemize}
\kant*[2][5]

\end{example}

\kant*[2][1]
\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}
\kant*[2][2]


\typeout{---------- Before ----------------}

\kant*[2][1]
\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}

New para

\typeout{--------- Separate -----------------}

Separate:

\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}


\typeout{--------- After -----------------}

\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}
Continued.
