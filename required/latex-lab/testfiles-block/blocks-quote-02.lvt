\section{Display quotation in text}

In the \TeX{}book Don Knuth wrote
\begin{quote}
  Computer system manuals usually make a dull reading, but take a
  heart: This one contains JOKES every once in a while, so you might
  actually enjoy reading it.

  (However, most of the jokes can only be appreciated properly if you
  understand a technical point that is being made---so read
  carefully.)
\end{quote}
and continues with
\begin{quote}
  Another noteworthy characteristic of this manual is that it doesn't always tell the truth.
\end{quote}
and indeed both statements are true.

\subsection*{Commentary}

\begin{em}
  The above is clearly a single sentence with two quotes inside, which
  contain full sentences in their own right and with longer quotes the
  quote itself could contain several paragraphs (like the first).

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    
    This can't be adequately represented just with \struct{P} and
    \struct{BlockQuote} structures because of the fact that
    \struct{P}s can't be nested. Just using \struct{P} and
    \struct{BlockQuote} without nesting means that you do not in way
    indicate that the single outer sentence forms a unit.

  \item
    In the last LWG meeting I presented an approach in which the whole
    sentence was tagged with a single \struct{P} and the display
    quotes where all wrapped in \struct{Figure}s (allowed inside
    \struct{P}) and in there in a \struct{BlockQuote}. However, as it
    was pointed out last time, the downside of that approach is that
    most processors would not consider a figure as a textual object
    and would require/expect alternate text (which would make little
    sense)


  \item
    We now solve this in \LaTeX{} differently by introducing adding a
    \struct{text-unit} (text paragraph) structure (rollmapped to
    \struct{Part}. This way we can represent the outer sentence as a
    single \struct{text-unit} (indicating what belongs together) and
    the components as \struct{text}s (rollmapped to \struct{P}) and
    \struct{BlockQuotes}s.

  \item
    Note however, that splitting the single sentences into three
    \struct{text}s plus two \struct{BockQuote}s somewhat violates
    PDF/UA-2, because according to that standard a sentence should be
    represented in a single \struct{P}, while the solution with
    \struct{Figure} violates requirements for alternative text,
    boundingbox, etc. So there is some unresolved issue here if real
    world examples are to be represented.
  \end{itemize}
\end{em}
