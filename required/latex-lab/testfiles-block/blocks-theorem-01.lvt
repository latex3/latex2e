\section{On theorem-like structures}

We pretend to be in the middle of a document --- the section number is
therefore already 4. Possibly lengthy paragraph text is indicated by
some dummy ``Kantian text''.

\kant[1][1]

\begin{thm}
  \label{thm:A}
   A theorem \ldots \kant[2][1]
   \begin{equation} (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \end{equation}
   \kant[2][2]
\end{thm}

Some text outlining the proof \ldots{} \kant[1][2]

\begin{lem}
  A lemma to needed for the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:A}.
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
  A second lemma to needed for the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:A}.
\end{lem}


\section{Another section in the document}

Intro text to another theorem \ldots{} \kant[1][3]

\begin{thm}[It has a name]
  \label{thm:B}
   Another theorem \ldots \kant[2][2]

   \kant[2][3]
\end{thm}

\begin{lem}
  A third lemma to needed for the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:B}.
\end{lem}


\subsection*{Commentary}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Theorem-like structures are usually numbered with some title forming
  a visual label for reference. They act like headings, but do not
  integrate into the document's heading structure, e.g., Theorem 1
  might be inside a section, while Theorem 2 might be located in a
  subsection (not the case above).

\item
  There is often a relation to the heading structure, though; for example, in
  the above example, all Lemmas are numbered within sections which is
  why we see 4.1, 4.2, and then 5.1.

\item
  Numbering schemes are varied and sometimes rather complex. Above,
  the Theorems are all number sequentially throughout the document,
  while Lemmas are number within sections. You also find cases where
  the different types share a single counter --- see second sample
  document where all structures share one counter and are all
  numbered within sections (\struct{H2}).

\item
  In the past \LaTeX{} has internally implemented theorem-like
  structures as a list with a single item. Given the available tagset
  of PDF that seems to be also the most appropriate solution as far as
  we can see, but perhaps there are other and better suggestions.

\item
  This version now uses different tags!
\end{itemize}
