	command \ProvidesFile to appear in HE8nachlieli.fd (PR3774), the
	file HE8frankruehl.fd was completely useless

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{marks}): The way Babel dealt with
	adding language information to the marks appeared to rely on
	LaTeX's definition of \markboth and \markright, but broke with
	classes such as amsart that contain a different definition (PR
	3750 and 3756). Also, the use of \noexpand broke with fancyhdr;

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Umlauts and trema's}): PR 3603
	mentions a problem in \LaTeX when \add@accent occurs in vertical

	Gianfranco Boggio-Togna (gbt at acm.org).

	* polish/polish.dtx : The double closing quote was defined using

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Since the equal
	sign may be used in TeX programming it needs to have it's default
	category code during language definition file processing. When
	turkish is loaded this isn't the case. Therefor the macros
	Ldfinit, ldf@quit and ldf@finish have been changed accordingly.
	Problem reported in PR 3398 by myself as occuring with latin.

	* catalan/catalan.dtx: The commands \l and \L didn't work when the

	was specified.

	* greek/greek.dtx : Regression testing revealed that ^^9f can't be
	fed to \initiate@active@char as such. It seemed to work, but made
	the caret active and brok in combination with a language that
	already had made the caret active. To circumvent this greek now
	uses the decimal number notation (159) instead of ^^9f where
	possible and makes the tilde act as ^^9f for the purpose of
	declaring it active.

2001-01-26 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): The
	optional argument of \cite is used for typesetting. Therefor the
	shorthands need only to be turned off in the second

2000-09-22 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	the hyphenation patterns file.

2000-09-21 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Language options}): Added the
	bulgarian option; support was provided by Georgi Boshnakov

2000-09-19 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* all language files: Added \glossaryname with the default
	translation of "Glossary" after a suggestion from Thomas Henlich
	(henlich at mmers1.mw.tu-dresden.de)

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Macros common to a number of

	implementation in PR3219 

2000-06-29 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/babel.dtx (subsubsection{\pkg{ifthen}}): When babel changes
	the definition of \ifthenelse in order to give \pageref it's
	original definition it needs to revert \pageref to its babel
	version inside the 2nd and 3rd arguments; not after the
	\ifthenelse instruction.
	PR 3224, found by Heiko Oberdiek (oberdiek at ruf.uni-freiburg.de)

2000-02-29 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* norsk/norsk.dtx: The shorthands are the same for both spelling
	variants; no need to use \CurrentOption in \declare@shorthand. The
	way it was done didn't work anyway,

2000-02-18 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Added the
	command \providehyphenmins to be used in the .ldf files. It will

	Found by Rune Kleveland (runekl at math.uio.no)

2000-01-21 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* english/english.dtx : When the option USenglish was used the
	format of the date was *not* american. Also, in some cases the
	control sequence \l@<\Currentoption> was not properly
	defined. Found by Walter Schmidt (walter.schmidt at arcormail.de)

2000-01-20 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* swedish/swedish.dtx: Additions from Erik Östhols
	(erik_osthols at yahoo.com):
	- The unnecessary version of "=, which I really only included at
	the time because it was there in germanb.dtx, from whence I stole
	most (all?) of my ideas then, has been modified to something that
	is actually useful for typesetting Swedish, and which was (again)
	stolen from the finnish.dtx file. 
	- The likewise unnecessary "~, again stolen from germanb without
	my having a clear idea of why it would be useful, has been
	deleted.
	- The new and *very* useful version of \- as found in
	e. g. finnish.dtx has been included. 
	- The definitions of "a, "A, "o etc. have been changed to allow
	subsequent hyphenation, as in current versions of germanb.
	- As typesetting the date as "20 januari 2000" is, if not
	uncommon, then at least much less common than some other varieties
	of formatting of dates in Sweden, two commands have been added to
	provide for the much more common "20/1 2000" and "2000-01-20".

2000-01-08 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* polish/polish.dtx : The definition of \datepolish contained an

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Introduced an extra
	level of expansion in the definition of an active caret

	definition of the ^ to babel.def in case some other language needs
	to have ^ as a shorthand character as well.

1999-12-16 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* catalan/catalan.dtx : Make sure that the shorthand characters
	are turned off outside of catalan. Found by Javier Bezos
	(jbezos at arrakis.es)
	This also holds for other language definitions: basque.dtx,
	breton.dtx, danish.dtx, finnish.dtx, galician.dtx, german.dtx,
	icelandic.dtx, ngerman.dtx, norsk.dtx, polish.dtx, portuges.dtx,

1999-12-01 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Need to redefine

	\@let@token. Found by Javier Bezos (jbezos at arrakis.es)

1999-11-29 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* catalan/catalan.dtx : Make sure the the `-character has catcode

	definition of the active ^.

1999-09-29 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* greek/greek.dtx : The greek language support now makes use of
	the language attribute feature. But in order not to break older
	documents some extra code is needed to make the option
	polutonikogreek work.

1999-09-16 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/bbplain.dtx (section{Support for formats based on
	\textsc{plain}\TeX}): Added the command \@ifundefined which is
	used in the definition of active charcters since Babel 3.6Z

1999-09-06 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): The change from 08/27
	was rubbish; now use \let instead of \edef
	
1999-08-27 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* cyrillic/{russianb,ukraineb}.dtx : Made not using the inputenc
	package a warning rather than an Error message after user
	requests.

1999-08-19 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): The proposed fix for
	PR3050 doesn't work; use \strip@prefix\meaning.

1999-08-18 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* frenchb/frenchb.dtx (subsection{Date and clean up}): No longer
	use \edef to define \today; the accent commands are not expandable
	and generate error messaages. (PR 3083, found by Thomas Esser
	(te at informatik.uni-hannover.de))

1999-06-22 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): When the shorthand
	character is already active make sure it gets expanded once
	instead of fully when \normal@char<char> is defined. This can be
	acheived by using \expandafter\noexpand (PR 3050, found by Joachim
	Becker (jbecker1 at gwdg.de))

1999-04-30 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Only realy initiate a
	shorthand once (suggested by Javier Bezos)

	* italian/italian.dtx : Claudio Beccari introduced the " as  a
	shorthand to insert the compound word mark (when the encoding is
	T1) and added support for ISO 31/XI regulations

1999-04-29 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* greek/greek.fdd (section{The encoding definition file}): Removed
	the refinition of \& from the encoding file as it doesn't belong
	there.

	* greek/greek.dtx : Now switch the definition of \& via
	\extrasgreek (removed from the font encoding file); the greek
	fonts do not contain an &-sign.

1999-04-22 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): In some
	situations \lefthyphenmin remained equal to -1. This setting is
	now inside the group in which patterns are read. Also added the
	explicit setting of the hyphenmin paramters for language=0 as this
	didn't happen when the first pattern file changes \lefthyphenmin.
	For synonym languages the hyphenmin parameters were not set, this
	is now accomplished by storing the \languagename in \process@line
	Suggested by Vladimir Volovich (vvv at vvv.vsu.ru)

1999-04-21 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): It was
	reported by  Richard Walker (Richard.Walker at cs.anu.edu.au)
	(PR 3023) and "Igor A. Kotelnikov" (kotelnikov at nsu.ru) that babel
	brok the cite package This could be solved by *not* redefining
	\bibcite when the cite package is loaded.
	During testing it became clear that running the document the first
	time produced an error; solved by adding an \AtBeginDocument
	action. (babel 3.6v)

1999-04-20 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* base/bbcompat.dtx: Added code to issue a sensible error when the
	.sty files are loaded from LaTeXe; but made sure the document can
	be processed without complaints about \ProvidesLanguage not defined.
	(PR3020, Richard Walker (Richard.Walker at cs.anu.edu.au))
	Made sure the .sty and .ldf files can be used from plain TeX
	without hyphen.cfg preloaded.

	* base/babel.dtx (section{The Kernel of Babel}): When plain.def is
	loaded from switch.def we need to define \adddialect first in
	order to access the second part. (babel 3.6u)

1999-04-20 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Removed the braces again
	(PR3022) as the cure poses more problems than it solves. Will
	need to find a different solution for the active ^ in esperanto.

1999-04-18 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* turkish/turkish.dtx : Incorporated corrections received quite
	some time ago from "H. Turgut Uyar" (uyar at cs.itu.edu.tr)

1999-04-16 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* greek.dtx, babel.dtx : Moved redefinition of \@roman and \@Roman
	back the the greek language support because of the problems it
	causes with the AMS document classes. This problem needs to be
	solved in a different way; \@roman needs to be used in expansion
	only places.
	Reported by Jean-Francois Mertens (jfm at core.ucl.ac.be)(PR 3017)

1999-04-13 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): The
	redefinition of \bibcite didn't work for the natbib package; a
	redefinition that works for natbib doesn't work without it.
	Now bibcite defines itself during the processing of the .aux file
	which is done *before* the \AtBeginDocument commands are executed.
	Found by Niilo Siljamo (siljamo at sateenkaari.meteo.helsinki.fi)
	(PR 3011) (babel 3.6s)

1999-04-12 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Language options}): Re-instated the
	loading of babel.def right at the begining of babel.sty as it is
	needed to define \ProvidesLanguage. The need for postponing it has
	gone, because \bbl@redefine is no longer used as a warning
	mechanism against missing options (changed in 3.6p dd 9/4/99)
	Found by Werner Struckmann (struck at ips.cs.tu-bs.de) (PR 3006) and
	"Walter Schmidt" (wschmi at ibm.net) (PR 3014) babel 3.6r

1999-04-12 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Encodig issues (part 1)}): The parsing of

	ngerman and naustrian to support the new german orthography, as
	supplied by "Walter Schmidt" (wschmi at ibm.net)

1999-04-09 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{marks}): The solution for PR2990 wasn't
	perfect; the arguments to the \mark... commands need to be stored
	in a token register prior to using \edef.
	(subsection{Language options}): Now check for the existence of
	\bbl@main@language instead of redefining \bbl@redefine to detect
	missing options.

	* bahasa.dtx : February should be Pebruari according to
	Mohammad DAMT (mdamt at cakraweb.com)

	Found by Thomas Esser (te at informatik.uni-hannover.de), (PR 2851)

1999-04-08 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{marks}): Removed th use of \head@lang in
	passing the current language into the marks. This didn't work for
	amsart.cls. Found a new solution wich works for the stansdard
	document classes as well as for amsart.
	Reported by Vittorio Coti Zelati (zelati at cds.unina.it) (PR 2990)

1999-04-07 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Encodig issues}): Needed to move the
	\AtBeginDocument test for the loading of fontenc right up front of
	babel.sty; also added a test for `manual' selection of T1 without
	loading fontenc (via \renewcommand\encodingdefault{T1}) as
	suggested by Claudio Beccari (Beccari at polito.it)

1999-04-05 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx : Had to implement a diferent way to check for fontenc
	with T1 encoding; now pare \@filelst (PR 3002)

	Replaced \CYRUKRI with \CYRII in \authorname, typo, found by 
	Andrij Shvaika (ashv at icmp.lviv.ua)

	* babel.dtx (section{The Package File}): Don't load babel.def from
	babel.sty, but rather define \LdfInit temporarily in order to load

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands for quotation marks}): The
	definitions of \grq and \grqq should be dependent on the
	fontencoding. Taken the code from german.sty (and adapted it to

	* babel.dtx (section{The Package File}): The option
	KeepShorthandsActive no longer defines a control sequence. This
	didn't always work because of the order in which options are
	processed. The presence of the option is now tested in babel.def
	with \@ifpackagewith. (PR 2452)

1997-03-18 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (section{Identification}): Added the macro
	\ProvidesLanguage to identify language definition files instead of
	using \ProvidesFile. This is done to prevent problems with the
	dummy definition of \ProvidesFile for plain based formats. Some

	\markboth in order to be able to pass the language attribute to
	the headlines.

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Now reset the
	safe@actives switch *inside* the second and third arguments of
	\ifthenelse in order to be able to use shorthands there.

	PR 2421.

	shorthand with no argument and for a shorthand with an empty
	argument.

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Made \bbl@afterelse and
	\bbl@afterfi \long in order to be able to handle \par
	as the argument of a shorthand. This is needed in order to make
	shorthands fully expandable again.

1997-02-19 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* greek.dtx : Added command \greek@tilde to stand for the tilde
	character; change definition of \~ to produce the tilde character
	when in greek typesetting. This is necessary to produce the
	desired ligature effect.

	* bbplain.dtx : The redefinition of \dump tried to detect
	LaTeX2.09; it did that with \document; that cs is also defined by
	AMSTeX, hence an error occured building a Babel-AMSTeX format.

	enough). (Found by Thomas Esser)

1996-12-30 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* bbplain.dtx : Make this file be processed twice, once during
	format generation, but only a small portion of the file is loaded
	into the format, the second time the file is processed is when it
	is loaded from babel.def. This way some code that is not needed in
	the format gets removed and the plain format with babel is no
	longer incompatible with german.sty.

1996-10-04 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* dutch.dtx: Merged in the definitions for `afrikaans' as supplied
	by Stoffel Lombard (lombc at b31pc87.up.ac.za)

	needed for slovenian according to Primoz Peterlin
	(peterlin at biofiz.mf.uni-lj.si).

1996-09-20 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* catalan.dtx : Added a check for mathmode to the definitino of
	\lgem and \Lgem, as the use of these in mathmode makes no sense
	according to Goncal Badenes. Not having the check led to an error
	message (PR 2261)

1996-08-18 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* polish.dtx : The macros \sob, \spb and \skb need to call
	\leavevmode; when they are encountered in vertical mode TeX issues
	an error about \lower not being allowed in vertical mode. (found
	by Wlodzimierz Macewicz (macewicz at ia.pw.edu.pl))

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): In order to
	prevent problems while reading .fd files in the middle of a
	document we need to add the " and ' characters to \nfss@catcodes
	untill LaTeX does that herself. (found by Tomas	Bautista
	(bautista at cma.ulpgc.es)) 

1996-08-15 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* bbplain.dtx : Added default (semi-NFSS2) definition of \ss and
	\i because german.sty in combination with a babel format creates
	an endless lopp on those glyphs. (Found by Bernd Raichle)

	* danish.dtx : According to Peter Busk Laursen the shorthand "'
	needs to typeset the german closing double quote (``). He also
	suggested to add the definitions for "~ and "=

1996-08-13 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Top level expansion of
	\normal@char<char> where the shorthand character is already active
	should be the expansion of the active character, not the active
	character itself as this causes an endless loop (found by Tomas
	Bautista (bautista at cma.ulpgc.es))

1996-08-11 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Redefinition
	of \ifthenelse added to circumvent problems with \pageref in the

	in \toks8 (PR 2213)
	Consistently use \@undefined instead of \undefined (PR 2213)
	Use \@empty instead of \empty to be consistent with \LaTeX
	(PR 2133) 

	* bahasa.dtx : Added translation of `Proof' as suggested by
	knappen at vkpmzd.kph.uni-mainz.de (J"org Knappen) (PR 2214)

	** released Babel 3.6-beta **
 	
1996-07-06 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dst: Added the generation of the font description files to
	the main installation file. (PR 2208)

	* babel.dtx : added greek to the driver files, input russianb.dtx
	instead of russian.dtx, define \Babel in driver file (PR 2209)
	Removed an extra closing brace in changes entry for \dj (PR 2208)

	* germanb.dtx : added \allowhyphens in the definitions of "a, "o,
	"u, "A, "O, "U, because the underlying macro \lower@umlaut can not
	cntain a \allowhyphens. The reason is that for *dutch* we need to
	use discretionaries for these same characters in order to make the
	trema disappear at a word break. A \allowhyphens inside one of the
	arguments of \discretiionary leads to a TeX error.

1996-05-29 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Added an environment
	otherlanguage* wich does not switch the captions and date strings,
	only hyphenation and extras.

1996-04-18 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* magyar.dtx : Added translation of `Proof' as suggested by
	Alexin Zoltan (alexin at sol.cc.u-szeged.hu) and changed some of the
	translations as suggested by Peter Rajczy (rajczy at caesar.elte.hu).

1996-04-09 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}):

1996-03-06 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Added a system level
	shorthand for the ` to prevent an endless loop when the user
	enters `{}blah in his document.

	* catalan.dtx : Added `` as a shorthand for the double left quote;
	getting a single quote and an accented letter from the input ``a
	is not quit what would be expected.

1996-02-12 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* czech.dtx (section{The Czech language}): Fixed tow errors found
	by Petr Sojka (sojka at daeron.fi.muni.cz) (PR #2082) and added
	translation for `Proof'

1996-01-25 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Store and restore the lccode
	of the ~-character so it remains unchanged by
	\initiate@active@char

1996-01-24 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Macros common to a number of languages}):
	Moved \german@dq@disc, \usorbian@dq@disc and \swedish@dq@disc to
	babel.def, changing the name to \bbl@disc

1996-01-21 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Revert the
	previous change; \@setref gets expanded too late which results in
	TeX errors because the active character isn't redefined when TeX
	tries to use it in constructing a csname.

1996-01-19 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Redefine
	\@setref instead of \ref and \pageref for LaTeX2e. This (partly)
	solves PR0947 which complains about pageref being used in the
	argument of \ifthenelse. This now works as long as the label
	doesn't contain active characters.

1996-01-18 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* croatian.dtx : Added translation of the word `Proof' and changed
	the definition of \datecroatian according to the suggestion by

1996-01-16 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Use
	\strip@prefix only on bbl@tempa (in \@testdef) when \bbl@tempa <>
	\relax! 

1996-01-15 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* bbplain.dtx: Added the code that implements \newcommand (or
	enough of it to make \ProvideTextCommandDefault and friends
	work).

1996-01-10 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (section{The Package File}): Now use frenchb.dtx from
	Daniel Flipo as the source for french support in Babel.

1996-01-09 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Deal with charcters that are
	already active: define the top level expansion inside the \if
	branch of the category code test; define all lower level expansion
	macros needed for the shorthand stuff after of the \else branch
	(subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Complete rewrite of
	\@testdef using meaning to prevent endless complaints from LaTeX
	about possibly changed labels.

1995-12-01 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Reset the category code of a
	shorthand char at the end of the package and re-activate it at
	begin document.

1995-11-25 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

1995-11-16 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Changed the
	definition of \selectlanguage and \selectlanguage_; the former no
	longer processes its argument, that task is now performed by
	\selectlanguage_

1995-11-15 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Added the
	commands \bbl@redefine and \bbl@redefinerobust and used them to
	redefine \newlabel, \@testdef, \ref, \pageref, \label, \@citex,
	\nocite, \bibcite, \@bibitem, \@lbibitem

1995-11-11 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* francais.dtx : Added setting of the lowercase code of the ' to
	improve hyphenation 

1995-11-11 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* galician.dtx : Added '' as shorthand to produce the expected
	effect. 

1995-11-10 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* catalan.dtx : Added setting of the lowercase code of the ' to
	improve hyphenation
	(As suggested by Claudio Beccari (BECCARI at polito.it))

	* italian.dtx : Added setting of the lowercase code of the ' to
	improve hyphenation 
	(As suggested by Claudio Beccari (BECCARI at polito.it))

	* romanian.dtx :  Added translation of the word `Proof'

1995-11-08 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* bbplain.dtx: Added the code that `snatched' \dump as it is still
	needed for LaTeX 2.09

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Removed the code
	that `snatched' \dump as it is no longer needed for LaTeX.

1995-11-06 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): No longer use
	\bblref_ as a cs; instead use \ref_ and check if it isn't defined
	already.  (PR 1851)

1995-11-03 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* slovene.dtx : New translation of Index; replaced slovanian with

	* catalan.dtx: Added '| to disable the accent when an apostrophe
	is wanted.

1995-08-31 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* germanb.dtx : Added \allowhyphens to the accent producing
	shorthands. Not having it prevented hyphenation for accented words
	in OT1 encoding. Having it means that TeX possibly misses a
	possible breakpoint. Putting \allowhyphens into the definition of
	\lower@umlaut (which would make it not appear at all in T1
	encoding) is a no-no because it leads to improper discretionary
	errors for dutch (were trema's have to disappear when the word is
	hyphenated next to the trema). (PRs 1118, 1147, 1714, 1846)

1995-08-30 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Added a missing
	%-character in the definition of \selectlanguage (PR1841)

	* francais.dtx : Added a missing %-character in the definition of
	\captionsfrancais (PR1841)

1995-08-17 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* spanish.dtx, catalan.dtx, galician.dtx: Combining
	\initiate@active@char and \bbl@activate in one \@ifpackagewith
	statement leads to an error message about an \inaccessible control
	sequence from \select@language. For now split these statements.

1995-08-07 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands for quotation marks}):
	Corrected the spelling of \quil... to \guil...

	* irish.dtx : load irish.cfg instead of danish.cfg

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Use \empty instead
	of \@empty in the test for the hyphenation exception file; \@empty
	is undefined in plain.

	by Enn Saar)

1995-07-10 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* catalan.dtx : Added translation of the word `Proof'

	* catalan.dtx: Removed support for ~n; add `` and '' as
        shorthands.

1995-07-07 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* francais.dtx, breton.dtx: Postpone the declaration of the
        TextCompositeCommands untill \AtBeginDocument

1995-07-04 Johannes Braams  (babel at latex-project.org)

	* babel.dtx (section{The Package File}): Added the options
