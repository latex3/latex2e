The LaTeX `cyrillic` bundle
===========================

Release 2024-06-01 patch level 0

Overview
--------

This bundle consists of LaTeX2e packages for Cyrillic languages
supported by the LaTeX Project.

Installation
------------

We no longer distribute installation instructions for the various TeX
implementations. All modern TeX systems include `cyrillic` as-standard, and end
users should in general use the release versions supplied in this way.

Release distribution is carried out only through the CTAN archives.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

If you wish to report a problem or bug in the `cyrillic` bundle
please use the [Issue Tracker for LaTeX2e on
GitHub](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues)
and follow the guidelines that pop up if you press the "New issue" button.

In particular, to check that you are really seeing a bug, please write
a short, self-contained document that shows the problem. This should
include the `latexbug` package, which will warn if your test file is
not suitable for one or the other reason. See the [CONTRIBUTING
guide](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for further details, or if you need to obtain the `latexbug` package.

If the bug turns out to be with third-party software then please
contact the developer, and not us!
